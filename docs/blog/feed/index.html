It fits well with my belief that scholars &amp;ndash; especially in a post Edward Snowden world &amp;ndash; need to understand the engineered nature of the virtualmachines they use in their work (regardless of whether they want to build digital outputs or not). Achieving a robust level of scholarly self-consciousness in the digital age is a challenge that most people have (I suggest) given up on, in the face of technological advance rather than methodological choice or epistemological orientation. This has huge implications for the integrity of future scholarship, but opens up equally fascinating areas for research and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

My suggestion is that we need to stop &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thinking about the specific technical skills a digital humanist needs, and consider the function the (extra)discipline plays in the broader community, as well as the role(s) it is likely to need to play in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://example.com/blog/2013/09/07/digital-humanists-as-master-builders/</guid></item><item><title>Speaking Back to America, Localizing DH Postcolonialism</title><link>http://example.com/blog/2013/09/04/speaking-back-to-america-localizing-dh-postcolonialism/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve put off writing this post for a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure about publishing it because I need to keep thinking it through and catching up on some reading on the topic.

&lt;p&gt;I can only offer a very formative overview of this subject here, but I&amp;rsquo;m keen to at least put it on the radar. As everyone knows, vast amounts of our cultural heritage are either being digitized and put online or being born online, and this has significant implications for the arts and humanities. In particular, it forces us to start increasing our understanding of, and capability with, the engineered technologies that deliver resources to us online. It will always be difficult getting the balance right &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re never going to be engineers &amp;ndash; but we need to start working through the issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://example.com/blog/2013/07/03/requirements-for-a-new-zealand-humanities-eresearch-infrastructure/</guid></item><item><title>Evaluating Scholarly Digital Outputs: The 6 Layers Approach</title><link>http://example.com/blog/2012/09/20/evaluating-scholarly-digital-outputs-the-6-layers-approach/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This post was republished as &amp;lsquo;Evaluating Scholarly Digital Outputs: The 6 Layers Approach&amp;rsquo;, &lt;a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-scholarly-digital-outputs-by-james-smithies/"&gt;Journal of Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, 1:1, Fall, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of appropriate standards for the evaluation of scholarly digital outputs has come up in conversation at my institution (the University of Canterbury, New Zealand) recently and I&amp;rsquo;ve realised I haven&amp;rsquo;t got a ready or simple answer, usually replying that such standards are extremely important because we need to ensure scholarly digital outputs attain to the same standards as, say, monographs, but that they&amp;rsquo;re evolving. The conversations normally don&amp;rsquo;t go much further than that. This post, then, is an attempt to get my thoughts down on paper so I can point colleagues to a handy url summarising my thoughts. Much of it will merely repeat common knowledge for digital humanists, but might be of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s a topic that has been dear to my heart for some time now. It touches on the question of where the digital humanities stand in relation to the core tradition, and what direction it&amp;rsquo;s going to take as a practice (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m keen for it to become a &amp;lsquo;discipline&amp;rsquo; in the traditional sense of the term). I&amp;rsquo;ve often said that if DH is to be taken seriously by the analog humanities it will need to begin to engage with some core humanities practices, develop some kind of theoretical framework(s), identify some core methodologies, and&amp;nbsp; generally produce some writing that has recognizable intellectual &amp;lsquo;grunt&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

It articulates a moral imperative that has long been a driving force of the digital humanities but is infrequently surfaced, perhaps for good reason given the dangers of mixing intellectual and cultural movements with claims that they coincide with the morally correct.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is that, while Amazon Web Services might not be suitable for all (or even many) digital humanities projects, and the platform isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly user friendly to people uncomfortable with the command line, it does offer an extremely scalable cloud infrastructure and a nice way to package up web application stacks for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

My activities over the past few years have hit the radar of some of my close colleagues, and latterly a slightly wider audience with the publication of this blog and &lt;a href="http://www.humanitiesmachine.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;www.humanitiesmachine.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;m constrained by only working in the digital humanities in my spare time, and outside a university setting. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to Paul Millar at the University of Canterbury Humanities Computing Unit for both setting up the unit (it represents a significant advance) and adding me, and therefore my occasionally intemperate ideas, as a Research Associate, but we need to get more people onboard.&lt;/p&gt;
