<div class="post-entry"> <p><p>This page lists the projects and initiatives I&#39;m working on, or involved in. Sometimes they&#39;re little more than an attempt to learn a new tool or method. Sometimes they represent an attempt to answer a specific research question. Sometimes the goal is to contribute to a local, national, or international community. They often involve collaborations with colleagues, software vendors, IT support staff, and team members with considerably more technical skills than I have. The results are variable. I make no claim that the digital humanities are radically transformative or always useful for teaching or research; the digital arts, social sciences, and humanities remain a work in progress. I have a strong preference for open source technologies. For a list of my other research outputs please refer to my <a href="http://localhost/writing">writing</a> and <a href="http://localhost/talks">talks</a> pages. </span></span></p></p> </div>

                <h5>jamessmithies.org</h5>
                <p><p>This project is based on the notion of &#39;full-stack digital humanities&#39;, where the entire technology stack - from server to application to DNS routing - is built and maintained by the author. This is informed in some ways by the DH craft ethos, but also by a desire to embed scholarly values in every layer of the technical process. By using open source code and hosting it on a minimal computer (for 5 years), I not only regained a sense of control I lose when using commercial products, but learned useful skills and deepened my understanding of technology.</p>

The ARDC Social Science Research Infrastructure Network (SSRIN) project responds to the plan, addressing the most pressing research infrastructure needs facing the social sciences in Australia. The project is led by the University of Queensland. ARDC, through its&nbsp;<a href="https://ardc.edu.au/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/">HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons&nbsp;</a>(HASS-I RDC), is co-investing $4.43 million in the initiative, alongside co-investment from partners that brings the total investment to $8.86 million. Specifically, the project aims to:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>improve discoverability, accessibility and usability of social science data</li>
	<li>enhance existing data infrastructure relevant for the social sciences</li>
	<li>build capacity among social science researchers in Australia</li>
	<li>improve engagement and build collaborations between key stakeholders in universities, government, NGOs and communities</li>
</ul>

<p>The HASS Digital Research Hub (HDRH) are helping to deliver Activity Stream 6: Training and Capacity Building. The work will develop a comprehensive training program in quantitative and qualitative methods, data analytics, and digital tools for domain researchers in alignment to academic and research software engineering (RSE) career frameworks. It will promote professional development opportunities through workshops, seminars, and online courses, and will encourage interdisciplinary learning and collaboration to broaden researchers&#39; skill sets.&nbsp;</p></p>

                <p><p>I was UK Principal Investigator for <em>MaDiH (مديح): Mapping Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan</em>, an AHRC / Newton funded collaborative project between King&rsquo;s Digital Lab (KDL), the Hashemite University, the Council for British Research in the Levant (CBRL), the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, the Jordanian Open Source Association, and the Endangered Archaeology in the Middle East and North Africa (EAMENA) project. The project ran for two years, from February 2019 - February 2021. The project contributed to the long-term sustainable development of Jordan&rsquo;s digital cultural heritage, identifying key systems, datasets, standards, and policies, and aligning them to government digital infrastructure capabilities and strategies.

                <p><p>I provided advice to the Georgian Papers Programme in my capacity as Director of King&#39;s Digital Lab. King&#39;s College London and the Royal Archives established the Georgian Papers Programme (GPP) to enrich public historical understanding of Britain, George III, British monarchy and a crucial period in British and world history. The GPP was a partnership between the Royal Collection Trust and King&rsquo;s College London, and was joined by primary United States partners the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and the College of William &amp; Mary. The project aimed to transform the understanding of eighteenth-century North America and Georgian Britain and its monarchy, at a time of profound cultural, political, economic and social change which created the modern nation.</p>

                <p><p>This site provided &lsquo;ready to eat&rsquo; academic infrastructure, with an emphasis on the digital humanities, in the form of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Each AMI provided a base LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server stack, along with a pre-configured academic web application. They could be booted up very easily, providing &#39;virtualmachiness&#39; to experiment with new technologies or run workshops. They were not configured for production use, but could be upgraded to allow for this.&nbsp;The site was active from 2013 - 2021.
