AB  - The text of my contribution to the Critical Infrastructure Studies panel at MLA 2018, New York, January 6th, 2018. The panel was framed by comments by Alan Liu (University of California, Santa Barbara), Matthew K. Gold (The Graduate Center, CUNY), and comprised Tung-Hui Hu (The University of Michigan), Shannon Mattern (The New School), Tara McPherson (University of Southern California), and me. The paper argues that in an era when cultural politics are defined by the digital, and the arts and humanities (like all disciplines) are confronted with a complex soup of systems engineering, tools, datasets, and emerging computational methodologies and epistemologies, the intellectual challenge turns from merely critiquing the literary and cultural domain to reflecting on the infrastructure that influences and shapes that activity. Such inquiry calls for a level of self-reflexivity — acknowledgement of the intersection of critic and machine — that demands macro as well as micro focus and a willingness to attend to sometimes dizzying complexity. No easy resolution is possible, Smithies suggests. The promise of critical infrastructure studies is not so much a definition of global humanities infrastructure, as a seed for a genre of writing on and about critical entanglement with computing platforms, methods, and devices.

AB  - The digital humanities has a long history of innovation in technology, techniques and communications. Historically, innovation tends to be associated with business processes. Critics may object to such ‘industry’ language and claim that ‘innovative’ processes may in fact lead, inevitably, to instrumentalist perspectives.

Presented at the DH2015, University of Western Sydney. </div><div class="blink"><a href="javascript:show(this);" onclick="show(this);">abstract</a><div class="bibshowhide"><div class="abstract">The UC CEISMIC Digital Archive (Millar et al.‚ n.d.) was developed to store and make publically available digital content produced during the course of a major earthquake sequence‚ which hit the Canterbury region in the South Island of New Zealand between 2010 and 2012. The project was presented at DH2012‚ Hamburg‚ when its key assets had just gone live (Smithies‚ 2012). This report on the current state of the archive is the most significant to be made at a digital humanities conference since then. It will report on governance‚ ethics‚ and technology but‚ more importantly‚ reflect on lessons learned and outline plans for the next decade of operation.
The Canterbury earthquake sequence has been described as a truly ‘large-scale’ event. It included a devastating 6.3 magnitude tremor on 22 February 2011 that resulted in 185 deaths and caused significant damage to large portions of the city. Over 12‚000 aftershocks followed‚ including 31 greater than magnitude 5 on the Richter scale. Recovery is ongoing‚ with portions of the inner city only recently opened to the public. Significant infrastructure renewal and building remediation and construction are expected to continue across the city and surrounding areas for another decade (Johnston‚ 2014). The University of Canterbury‚ where the UC CEISMIC team is based‚ is planning for over 1‚000 construction workers to be on campus during 2015 to repair earthquake damage and build a significant new science and engineering block.
The UC CEISMIC project has been positioned by the University of Canterbury as one of four flagship projects targeted to lead the way towards recovery‚ and leads a consortium of 11 national organizations that has recently expanded to include scientific as well as cultural heritage agencies. The archive currently stores 80‚000 public items with a further 15‚000 either embargoed or in process‚ ranging from audio and video interviews to images and official reports. Tens of thousands more items await ingestion. Significant lessons have been learned about data integration in post-disaster contexts‚ including but not limited to technical architecture‚ governance‚ ingestion process‚ and human ethics. Team members have recently gained access to almost 1 million historic tweets‚ which will be subject to computationally intensive analysis (Williford and Henry‚ 2012).
The depth and breadth of the CEISMIC project‚ and the innovative work it has prompted‚ are directly attributable to it being a digital humanities project. The archive was modeled on the Center for History and New Media’s September 11 Digital Archive 1 and conceived‚ designed‚ and built by digital humanists. Its operational program office is staffed and managed by humanities and digital humanities graduates. Its core values are derived from principles instilled in all DH graduates: civic responsibility‚ the value of our digital cultural heritage‚ deployment of technology to enable research‚ use of open-source tools‚ the importance of craft skills and tacit knowledge‚ the importance of communication and community engagement‚ and our responsibility to future generations. It presents an excellent model for digital humanities teams faced with the problem of archiving significant post-disaster events.
The archive has implemented a technical architecture optimized to resolve issues with data integration in post-disaster contexts (Spennemann‚ 1999). The system relies on a bespoke research-oriented repository built using open-source tools and hosted at the University of Canterbury‚ New Zealand. It sits on virtualized university infrastructure‚ including access to New Zealand’s national High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure and REANNZ high-speed broadband research network. Tiered backup and recovery stores all content on both high-availability disk and off-site tape storage. DigitalNZ‚ a unit within the New Zealand National Library‚ performs national metadata aggregation (Oldman et al.‚ 2014). This allows the archive to leverage an extensive range of existing government IT infrastructure; although over 75% of CEISMIC content is hosted at the University of Canterbury‚ content is contributed from a wide range of government agencies. The federation is bonded at a technical level through DigitalNZ’s modified Dublin Core schema‚ with each contributing archive responsible for adding additional metadata if possible (Sugimoto et al.‚ 2002). Access is provided through one key and two subsidiary websites‚ a mobile app‚ and two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Long-term preservation has been outsourced to New Zealand’s National Digital Heritage Archive (NDHA)‚ a government agency responsible for preserving key national digital assets for the long term.
Unusually for a digital humanities project‚ CEISMIC has grown to become a significant ‘enterprise’-level undertaking‚ with a mature portfolio of services‚ relationships with peak government agencies from the chief executive level down‚ integration into the university’s project and technical change management functions‚ and strategic concerns that intersect not only with university but local and national government policy. Because of its vocal advocacy for digital cultural heritage archiving in the immediate post-disaster context‚ the project is positioned as a possible future repository of earthquake-related big data of radical size and scope (Spennemann‚ 1999). It is recognized as one of the success stories of the national earthquake experience; it reflects the development of post-disaster social capital in fundamental terms (Aldrich and Meyer‚ 2014).
Despite this‚ the CEISMIC project is well known as a community-focused effort with minimal staff and resources‚ struggling to attract external funding and move key operational staff from temporary to permanent contracts. Although there is awareness of the project at the ministerial level across multiple government departments‚ the scale of the CEISMIC ecosystem has made it difficult to secure a single business owner outside the research community. This tension is perhaps typical of many digital humanities projects: at once creative and vibrant‚ and under threat.
Despite this‚ and unlike other digital humanities post-disaster projects (Rivard‚ 2012)‚ the intention is to keep the CEISMIC project operational for several decades into the future. This is a perhaps radical aspiration that contrasts with the more modest goals of similar projects‚ but it offers interesting perspectives for the global community. New Zealand has a particular set of cultural values (and institutional characteristics) that make projects like CEISMIC possible. Lack of state boundaries‚ a small digital GLAM sector‚ and a tradition of cultural innovation and inter-disciplinary cooperation combine to allow the CEISMIC ecosystem to grow. Unlike other cyber-infrastructure projects‚ the archive has exceeded its initial goals and is implementing strategies that appear capable of securing it a long-term future. Again‚ this was due to the application of digital humanities values rather than computer science and engineering values‚ and achieved because it evolved from the bottom up‚ rather than being imposed (even with the benefit of significant funding) from the top down (Dombrowski‚ 2013). For these reasons it presents the global digital humanities community with a useful model that encompasses design‚ development‚ ethics‚ governance‚ and community engagement.

AB  - This paper will contribute to the global history of computing and the history of late twentieth century New Zealand. It will outline the history of computing in New Zealand from 1950 – 2000, charting the development of computational thinking and computers in that country and using computing history to help explain the relationship of New Zealand to post-industrial culture.

The University of Canterbury CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive draws on the example of the Centre for History and New Media’s (CHNM) September 11 Archive‚ which was used to collect digital artefacts after the bombing of the World Trade Centre buildings in 2001‚ but has gone significantly further than this project in its development as a federated digital archive. The new University of Canterbury Digital Humanities Programme – initiated to build the archive – has gathered together a Consortium of major national organizations to contribute content to a federated archive based on principles of openness and collaboration derived directly from the international digital humanities community. Two primary archive ‘nodes’ have been built by the Ministry of Culture and Heritage (‘QuakeStories’) and the University of Canterbury (‘QuakeStudies’) to collect content from the public and researchers respectively‚ and a ‘front window (www.ceismic.org.nz) has been provided by the University of Canterbury to bond the Consortium‚ raise funds‚ and provide a platform for future aggregated search functions‚ which will be powered by New Zealand’s bespoke cultural heritage schema maintained by Digital NZ. Other nodes in the federation include The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa‚ the National Library‚ Christchurch City Libraries‚ NZ On Screen‚ and the Canterbury Museum. The aim is to create a permanent record of digital objects for both present and future generations. To this end the technical requirements for QuakeStudies have been reviewed by the National Digital Heritage Archive with a view to ingesting significant subsets of content (if not creating a complete dark archive) for long-term preservation. Significant attention has been paid during the design process to multi-cultural and multi-lingual requirements‚ to ensure content from a broad range of New Zealand communities can be ingested and researched. Future development aims to create a bi-lingual interface in English and Māori.
The story behind the UC CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive goes somewhat further than other similar digital archives. Not only is it being used to initiate New Zealand’s first Digital Humanities programme‚ but it hopes to fulfil an important role in the cultural and intellectual recovery of the Canterbury region following the earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. New Zealand is a country with significant levels of technology uptake‚ and the vast majority of content produced following the earthquakes was created in digital form. As the central focus of the recovery efforts was‚ of necessity‚ focussed on the physical and spiritual well-being of the Canterbury public‚ it was quite possible that large amounts of valuable content would be lost to future generations. This altered somewhat after the initial phase of critical response ended‚ only to be replaced with new issues. Various institutions began gathering digital content into their separate repositories‚ but no co-ordinated approach was taken‚ creating a situation where disparate ‘nodes’ of content might be stored with little possibility of sharing and reuse. It was becoming possible that‚ although terabytes of content would be captured‚ future generations of citizens and researchers would need to go to myriad different archives‚ each with their own metadata standards‚ in order to get a complete picture of events. Aside from the obvious inconvenience of this‚ such a situation would seriously constrain the possibility of sophisticated downstream data analysis and content reuse. 
The digital humanities ethos of sharing and open collaboration has had a significant positive effect in this context. Consistent recourse to the digital humanities’ message of collaboration has fostered a culture of trust that has in turn allowed an extremely broad Consortium to be initiated. Although there is little chance that the resulting federation will be technically seamless‚ this has allowed potential conflicts of interest to be put aside and technical discussions to start at a relatively early stage in proceedings‚ significantly enhancing the chances of developing a highly functional distributed archive. Additionally‚ the digital humanities’ emphasis on open communication and community engagement has fostered a healthy culture across the federation‚ which has contributed significantly to the success of the project. This is represented most forcefully in the use of not only crowd-sourcing techniques‚ but a mobile recording studio fitted out with video and audio equipment‚ that has been taken to the suburbs of Christchurch to record public reaction to the earthquakes. This pro-active approach‚ coupled with robust attention to project structure‚ governance and human ethics‚ has created not only a digital archive‚ but a community of friends and partners‚ and a vibrant new digital humanities programme.
The project is also unusual for a digital humanities project in it becoming a flagship project for the broader university. Although the project and research teams are predominantly from the arts and humanities‚ close collaboration is also occurring with computer scientists‚ health researchers‚ social scientists and economists. As with the interest from New Zealand’s national heritage agencies‚ digital humanities principles of collaboration and sharing‚ combined with well-considered metadata ontologies and system architecture‚ has prompted the project to occupy a central position in the post-earthquake recovery landscape. More than just an IT project‚ the CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive is providing local‚ national and international public and researchers with a forum for discussion‚ organization and collaboration as well as a heritage asset in itself. 
This paper will outline the project and present a model that will hopefully allow our approach to be reproduced in similar post-disaster recovery situations. Key to this model is the conscious use of digital humanities methodologies such as crowd-sourcing‚ community building and attention to open metadata ontologies and open access principles to create a robust and functional federated archive system. The model has several benefits‚ including the ability to develop a ‘distributed nodal network’ of archives and repositories independently‚ thus reducing the need for centralisation that would encumber development‚ but it requires a long-term vision and a strong governance framework to ensure the federation holds together and organizations feel comfortable sharing content. Similarly‚ while it offers excellent potential for teaching and research across the humanities as a whole‚ the relatively advanced nature of the project provides limited opportunity to involve students in system development. Instead‚ the project has created internships that will see students working as ‘curators’ on the research node in the federation‚ uploading content and taking responsibility for metadata quality and the integrity of manual procedures.</div></div></div><div class="blink"><a href="http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz:80/handle/10092/10687">source</a></div><div class="blink"><a href="javascript:show(this);" onclick="show(this);">bib</a><div class="bibshowhide"><div class="bib">@inproceedings{smithies_federated_2012,

AB  - The Canterbury region, in the South Island of New Zealand, experienced two major earthquakes during 2010 and 2011. On September 4 2010 a magnitude 7.1 quake struck at 4.35 am, causing widespread damage and two serious injuries. Significant aftershock sequences followed. On February 22 2011 a 6.3 magnitude quake hit at 12.51 pm. This earthquake caused severe damage and resulted in the loss of 181 lives, making it the second worst natural disaster in New Zealand history.
