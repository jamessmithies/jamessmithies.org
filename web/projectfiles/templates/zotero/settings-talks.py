#### AUTHENTICATION AND COLLECTIONS ######################################

# group_collection(160464, collection='MGID93AS')

user_collection(id='24279', api_key='Fsr4Rh9DUhd9x7W1TvnGQQJ0', collection='QEN7GPXH')

# group_collection(id, api_key=None, collection=None, top_level=False)
#user_collection(id, api_key=None, collection=None, top_level=False)
#
#   Use group_collection for a group library, user_collection for a
#   (private) user library.
#   ID specifies the group or user ID.
#
#   You may find your user ID for the library_id setting under
#   "Settings -> Feeds/API":
#        https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys
#
#   You may find your library ID by selecting the group on the Zotero
#   website, and then choose "Group Settings".  The URL in your browser
#   window will then show you a six-digit number,
#   e.g.,  .../groups/110233/settings
#
#   api_key
#       The secret key provided by Zotero.
#       If you want to retrieve non-public data from Zotero, you'll need a
#       Zotero account (or group) at zotero.org.  Log into your account,
#       access the Settings page on the Zotero site and create an private
#       API key (under "Settings -> Feeds/API").  For the key, check
#       "Allow library access".  This key is used in the api_key setting.
#
#   collection
#       ID of the top-level collection to be included.
#       All sub-collections under this collection will be imported.
#       If not given (None), all available collections will be included.
#
#   top_level
#       If true, then the collection given be included as a level.
#       Otherwise (default, False), sub-collections and items will be
#       included directly.


#### COLLECTIONS TO BE RENDERED ##########################################

# In your library, you may create a collection, for example, "website".
# Within it, create titled sub-collections, like so:

# toRead
# thesis
# website
#    10 Selected Works
#    20 Journal Articles
#    30 Conference Proceedings
#    40 Theses

# Now, find the IDs of the top-level collection called "website".
# When you click on it on the Zotero website, your browser will show you
# an alphanumeric key in the URL, e.g., items/collectionKey/FCQM2AY6.
# The portion 'FCQM2AY6' is what you would use in 'collection' for
# the user_collection or group_collection directives.


# To cause zot_bib_web to format a sub-collection in special ways, you
# may add some statements here.  For these statements, supply either
# the name (title) or the key associated with a collection.

# exclude_collection (C)
# Remove sub-collection C.

# rename_collection (C, N)
# Rename collection C to N.
# This may be used to merge collections by giving them the same name.

# hidden_collection (C)
# Hide sub-collection C.  We still add a shortcut at the top
# to unhide its contents if they are available elsewhere.
# You may also use a '-' before the name of the collection in the library.

# short_collection (C)
# Short mode.  This sub-collection will be shown using titles,
# journal and years only, which can then be expanded.  Journal or
# conference titles can be kept short.  Specify the "journal abbr or
# "conference title" fields, or a short "note" if necessary.  You may
# want to copy bibliographic items from other parts of the bibliography
# into this sub-collection.
# You may also use a '*' before the name of the collection in the library.

#short_collection("Selected Works")

# featured_collection (C)
# Feature this:  Extract this sub-collection and show at the beginning of
# the bibliography, regardless of whether the rest of the bibliography is
# sorted by, e.g., year, and ignores the collections otherwise. In the
# collection shown below, it prevents "in review" articles to show up as
# regular journal articles (which might give the impression you're
# taking credit for not-yet-reviewed/published material!)
# You may also use a '!' before the name of the collection in the library.

#featured_collection("Selected Works")

# misc_collection (C)
# Show the items in this collection, but exclude those items that
# are already included in another regular collection.  A regular
# collection is one that is not hidden, not short, and not featured.
# This is useful to add a "Miscellaneous" category at the end for
# additional items without duplicating anything.
# You may also use a '&' before the name of the collection in the library.

#misc_collection("Miscellaneous")


#### SPECIAL OPTIONS: STYLE ##############################################
# Special settings - configure only if needed.

# The sort_criteria determine the structure of the bibliography.
# Allowable values: 'type' (category of pub., e.g., journal article),
# 'date' (full date)
# 'year' (year of publication)
# 'collection' (the subcollection the article is placed in).
# Collection works best at the beginning of the list.
# add - in front of the field name to sort in descending order
# (e.g., -date will show the newest entries first).

# sort_criteria = ['collection','-date']   # collection, then by date.
sort_criteria = ['collection','-date']   # by type, then by date ("issued").
#sort_criteria = ['-year','type']   # Ordered by year, then type.

# Show the venues (conferences, journals) where we've published.
# the "shortcut" function offers some options:
# sortDir="asc" or "desc" instructs the program to sort the entries.
# (Default is automatic.)
# sortBy indicates that we'd like to sort by how many items there are
# in each category
#   (Default is to sort by name.  'count' is the only other value possible
#    at this time.)
# topN says to display only the 5 biggest categories.
# If there are several categories ranked 5, we're showing all of them.
# E.g.  topN=3 shows:  WIFN(8) FJJ(8) CLAM(5) CLEE(5)
