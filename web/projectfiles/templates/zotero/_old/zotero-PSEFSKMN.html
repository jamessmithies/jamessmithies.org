AB  - The emergence of the Internet has transformed the practice of the humanities and social sciences—more slowly than some may have hoped, but more profoundly than others may have expected. Digital cultural heritage resources are a fundamental dataset for the humanities: these resources, combined with computer networks and software tools, now shape the way that scholars discover and make sense of the human record, while also shaping the way their findings are communicated to students, colleagues, and the general public. Even greater transformations are on the horizon, as digitized cultural heritage comes into its own. But we will not see anything approaching complete digitization of the record of human culture, removal of legal and technical barriers to access, or revolutionary change in the academic reward system unless the individuals, institutions, enterprises, organizations, and agencies who are this generation's stewards of that record make it their business to ensure that these things happen.
