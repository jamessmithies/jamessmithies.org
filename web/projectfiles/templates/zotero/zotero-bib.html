A specific platform, the Humanities Networked Infrastructure, is explored as an example of how digital technologies enable the coproduction of the archive and at the same time extend the possibilities for serendipitous discovery.

Postmodernists are interested in deconstruction without reconstruction‚ second modernity is about deconstruction and reconstruction. Social sciences need to construct new concepts to understand the world dynamics at the beginning of the 21st century.
Modernity has not vanished‚ we are not post it. Radical social change has always been part of modernity. What is new is that modernity has begun to modernize its own foundations. This is what it means to say modernity has become reflexive. It has become directed at itself. This causes huge new problems both in reality and in theory. There has been a pluralization of the boundaries within and between societies‚ between society and nature‚ between Us and Other‚ between life and death. This pluralization also changes the inherent nature of boundaries. They become not so much boundaries as a variety of attempts to draw of boundaries. Border conflicts become transformed into conflicts over the drawing of boundaries. Where postmodernism simply celebrates this multiplication of boundaries‚ the theory of second modernity starts with the problem this new reality poses for individual and collective decisions‚ and with the problem that the continued existence of such decisions poses for theory. Institutions that are capable of such conscious boundary drawing are enabled in a way that those of the first modernity were not. But this process also generates qualitatively new kinds of trouble and crises. To investigate those troubles is to unveil the emergence of the second modernity.</div></div></div><div class="blink"><a href="javascript:show(this);" onclick="show(this);">bib</a><div class="bibshowhide"><div class="bib">@article{beck_theory_2003,

Social sciences need to construct new concepts to understand the world dynamics at the beginning of the 21st century.
Modernity has not vanished, we are not post it. Radical social change has always been part of modernity. What is new is that modernity has begun to modernize its own foundations. This is what it means to say modernity has become reflexive. It has become directed at itself. This causes huge new problems both in reality and in theory. There has been a pluralization of the boundaries within and between societies, between society and nature, between Us and Other, between life and death. This pluralization also changes the inherent nature of boundaries. They become not so much boundaries as a variety of attempts to draw of boundaries. Border conflicts become transformed into conflicts over the drawing of boundaries. Where postmodernism simply celebrates this multiplication of boundaries, the theory of second modernity starts with the problem this new reality poses for individual and collective decisions, and with the problem that the continued existence of such decisions poses for theory. Institutions that are capable of such conscious boundary drawing are enabled in a way that those of the first modernity were not. But this process also generates qualitatively new kinds of trouble and crises. To investigate those troubles is to unveil the emergence of the second modernity.

AB  - In this groundbreaking book, Franco Moretti argues that literature scholars should stop reading books and start counting, graphing, and mapping them instead. In place of the traditionally selective literary canon of a few hundred texts, Moretti offers charts, maps and time lines, developing the idea of “distant reading” into a full-blown experiment in literary historiography, in which the canon disappears into the larger literary system. Charting entire genres—the epistolary, the gothic, and the historical novel—as well as the literary output of countries such as Japan, Italy, Spain, and Nigeria, he shows how literary history looks significantly different from what is commonly supposed and how the concept of aesthetic form can be radically redefined.

TI  - Finding The True Voice of Feeling: Kendrick Smithyman and New Criticism in New Zealand, 1961-1963
AU  - Smithies, James
T2  - The Journal of Commonwealth Literature
AB  - Kendrick Smithyman is one of New Zealand’s lesser-known poets and literary critics, but this article argues that he was instrumental in developing a globally oriented critique which provides a welcome line of sight towards both America and the postmodern age. His series of essays on “Post-War New Zealand Poetry”, written between 1961 and 1963 and published in the fringe journal Mate, employed the principles of New Criticism to suggest ways of looking at New Zealand literature that were almost totally at odds with dominant New Zealand critics like Allen Curnow, E. H. McCormick and Bill Pearson. The essays were eventually expanded into the only full-length treatment of New Zealand poetry written (A Way of Saying, 1965), and represent a substantial contribution to the country’s literary critical tradition.

AU  - Smithies, James.
T2  - Journal of Victorian Culture
AB  - Modernist experimenters and self-conscious opponents of 'the Vic-torians' claimed writer, painter, musician, social critic, explorer and photographer, Samuel Butler (1835–1902) as an important intellectual forebear, but for many years after that he was simply ignored, ornoted as a mere curiosity – an interesting case of a signiﬁcant Victorian intellectual who coincidentally spent some time in New Zealand. John Stenhouse2 and Roger Robinson3 have gone some way towards altering this perception, but his signiﬁcance is deserving of more detailed examination. Butler represents an excellent example of return migration – a demographic trend that is often underestimated in narratives of colonization, but was instrumental in the colonization of both New Zealand and the wider empire. More broadly conceived as 'transitory colonization', this feature of our imperial past enables us to acknowledge the impact that transnational ﬂows of people, ﬁnances and ideas had on the colonization process – even at the very edge of empire, where the dominant themes were of geographic, cultural and intellectual backwardness.4 After staking out new colonial territory, digging up moa bones, scandalizing his friends with free-thought, and engaging Darwin with his erudite articulation of the theory of evolution, Samuel Butler returned to England with a new antipodean perspective on the modern world that explicates the basically synchronous relationship between England and its antipodes that existed during the mid-nineteenth century.

AB  - The emergence of the Internet has transformed the practice of the humanities and social sciences—more slowly than some may have hoped, but more profoundly than others may have expected. Digital cultural heritage resources are a fundamental dataset for the humanities: these resources, combined with computer networks and software tools, now shape the way that scholars discover and make sense of the human record, while also shaping the way their findings are communicated to students, colleagues, and the general public. Even greater transformations are on the horizon, as digitized cultural heritage comes into its own. But we will not see anything approaching complete digitization of the record of human culture, removal of legal and technical barriers to access, or revolutionary change in the academic reward system unless the individuals, institutions, enterprises, organizations, and agencies who are this generation's stewards of that record make it their business to ensure that these things happen.

Presented at the Digital Humanities Congress, University of Sheffield. </div><div class="blink"><a href="javascript:show(this);" onclick="show(this);">abstract</a><div class="bibshowhide"><div class="abstract">The digital humanities has a long history of innovation in technology‚ techniques and communications. Historically‚ innovation tends to be associated with business processes. Critics may object to such ‘industry’ language and claim that ‘innovative’ processes may in fact lead‚ inevitably‚ to instrumentalist perspectives. This paper will explore these issues through reference to “Open Innovation”‚ using the recent establishment of the King’s Digital Lab (KDL) at King’s College London (King’s) as a case study.

T2  - Digital Humanities Congress
AB  - The digital humanities has a long history of innovation in technology, techniques and communications. Historically, innovation tends to be associated with business processes. Critics may object to such ‘industry’ language and claim that ‘innovative’ processes may in fact lead, inevitably, to instrumentalist perspectives. This paper will explore these issues through reference to “Open Innovation”, using the recent establishment of the King’s Digital Lab (KDL) at King’s College London (King’s) as a case study.
KDL’s primary purpose is to increase digital capability across the Faculty of Arts & Humanities by working with academic staff to develop research proposals and projects, and deliver a range of digital research outcomes. The expectation is that the presence of the Lab will complement teaching and research in the Department of Digital Humanities (DDH) and further enhance the reputation King’s has in digital humanities. This paper will describe KDL plans (working with DDH) to underpin high quality teaching and research, but also high quality (industry standard) software development processes, and a culture of innovation, experimentation, and entrepreneurship.
Using KDL as a case study we will show how the concept of Open Innovation (as proposed by Henry Chesbrough) resonates strongly with the digital humanities. Concepts of being open (in terms of open sourcing or open access), pursuing open reflection and collaboration within Open Innovation, present a mirror in which we can see ourselves as digital humanities academics. This is a vision of the digital humanities as a catalyst for research across disciplines, providing a means to enable collaborations and intellectual partnerships, but also as IT industry professionals merely working in one of several knowledge domains. To this end, the paper will present a mapping demonstrating the contrast between the principles of Open and Closed Innovation, comparing different modes of communication and collaboration across the digital humanities.

Presented at the DH2015, University of Western Sydney. </div><div class="blink"><a href="javascript:show(this);" onclick="show(this);">abstract</a><div class="bibshowhide"><div class="abstract">The UC CEISMIC Digital Archive (Millar et al.‚ n.d.) was developed to store and make publically available digital content produced during the course of a major earthquake sequence‚ which hit the Canterbury region in the South Island of New Zealand between 2010 and 2012. The project was presented at DH2012‚ Hamburg‚ when its key assets had just gone live (Smithies‚ 2012). This report on the current state of the archive is the most significant to be made at a digital humanities conference since then. It will report on governance‚ ethics‚ and technology but‚ more importantly‚ reflect on lessons learned and outline plans for the next decade of operation.
The Canterbury earthquake sequence has been described as a truly ‘large-scale’ event. It included a devastating 6.3 magnitude tremor on 22 February 2011 that resulted in 185 deaths and caused significant damage to large portions of the city. Over 12‚000 aftershocks followed‚ including 31 greater than magnitude 5 on the Richter scale. Recovery is ongoing‚ with portions of the inner city only recently opened to the public. Significant infrastructure renewal and building remediation and construction are expected to continue across the city and surrounding areas for another decade (Johnston‚ 2014). The University of Canterbury‚ where the UC CEISMIC team is based‚ is planning for over 1‚000 construction workers to be on campus during 2015 to repair earthquake damage and build a significant new science and engineering block.
The UC CEISMIC project has been positioned by the University of Canterbury as one of four flagship projects targeted to lead the way towards recovery‚ and leads a consortium of 11 national organizations that has recently expanded to include scientific as well as cultural heritage agencies. The archive currently stores 80‚000 public items with a further 15‚000 either embargoed or in process‚ ranging from audio and video interviews to images and official reports. Tens of thousands more items await ingestion. Significant lessons have been learned about data integration in post-disaster contexts‚ including but not limited to technical architecture‚ governance‚ ingestion process‚ and human ethics. Team members have recently gained access to almost 1 million historic tweets‚ which will be subject to computationally intensive analysis (Williford and Henry‚ 2012).
The depth and breadth of the CEISMIC project‚ and the innovative work it has prompted‚ are directly attributable to it being a digital humanities project. The archive was modeled on the Center for History and New Media’s September 11 Digital Archive 1 and conceived‚ designed‚ and built by digital humanists. Its operational program office is staffed and managed by humanities and digital humanities graduates. Its core values are derived from principles instilled in all DH graduates: civic responsibility‚ the value of our digital cultural heritage‚ deployment of technology to enable research‚ use of open-source tools‚ the importance of craft skills and tacit knowledge‚ the importance of communication and community engagement‚ and our responsibility to future generations. It presents an excellent model for digital humanities teams faced with the problem of archiving significant post-disaster events.
The archive has implemented a technical architecture optimized to resolve issues with data integration in post-disaster contexts (Spennemann‚ 1999). The system relies on a bespoke research-oriented repository built using open-source tools and hosted at the University of Canterbury‚ New Zealand. It sits on virtualized university infrastructure‚ including access to New Zealand’s national High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure and REANNZ high-speed broadband research network. Tiered backup and recovery stores all content on both high-availability disk and off-site tape storage. DigitalNZ‚ a unit within the New Zealand National Library‚ performs national metadata aggregation (Oldman et al.‚ 2014). This allows the archive to leverage an extensive range of existing government IT infrastructure; although over 75% of CEISMIC content is hosted at the University of Canterbury‚ content is contributed from a wide range of government agencies. The federation is bonded at a technical level through DigitalNZ’s modified Dublin Core schema‚ with each contributing archive responsible for adding additional metadata if possible (Sugimoto et al.‚ 2002). Access is provided through one key and two subsidiary websites‚ a mobile app‚ and two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Long-term preservation has been outsourced to New Zealand’s National Digital Heritage Archive (NDHA)‚ a government agency responsible for preserving key national digital assets for the long term.
Unusually for a digital humanities project‚ CEISMIC has grown to become a significant ‘enterprise’-level undertaking‚ with a mature portfolio of services‚ relationships with peak government agencies from the chief executive level down‚ integration into the university’s project and technical change management functions‚ and strategic concerns that intersect not only with university but local and national government policy. Because of its vocal advocacy for digital cultural heritage archiving in the immediate post-disaster context‚ the project is positioned as a possible future repository of earthquake-related big data of radical size and scope (Spennemann‚ 1999). It is recognized as one of the success stories of the national earthquake experience; it reflects the development of post-disaster social capital in fundamental terms (Aldrich and Meyer‚ 2014).
Despite this‚ the CEISMIC project is well known as a community-focused effort with minimal staff and resources‚ struggling to attract external funding and move key operational staff from temporary to permanent contracts. Although there is awareness of the project at the ministerial level across multiple government departments‚ the scale of the CEISMIC ecosystem has made it difficult to secure a single business owner outside the research community. This tension is perhaps typical of many digital humanities projects: at once creative and vibrant‚ and under threat.
Despite this‚ and unlike other digital humanities post-disaster projects (Rivard‚ 2012)‚ the intention is to keep the CEISMIC project operational for several decades into the future. This is a perhaps radical aspiration that contrasts with the more modest goals of similar projects‚ but it offers interesting perspectives for the global community. New Zealand has a particular set of cultural values (and institutional characteristics) that make projects like CEISMIC possible. Lack of state boundaries‚ a small digital GLAM sector‚ and a tradition of cultural innovation and inter-disciplinary cooperation combine to allow the CEISMIC ecosystem to grow. Unlike other cyber-infrastructure projects‚ the archive has exceeded its initial goals and is implementing strategies that appear capable of securing it a long-term future. Again‚ this was due to the application of digital humanities values rather than computer science and engineering values‚ and achieved because it evolved from the bottom up‚ rather than being imposed (even with the benefit of significant funding) from the top down (Dombrowski‚ 2013). For these reasons it presents the global digital humanities community with a useful model that encompasses design‚ development‚ ethics‚ governance‚ and community engagement.

Presented at the eResearch NZ 2014, Massey University. </div><div class="blink"><a href="javascript:show(this);" onclick="show(this);">abstract</a><div class="bibshowhide"><div class="abstract">The UC CEISMIC Digital Archive was established in 2011 to identify‚ archive‚ and make publically accessible digital content related to the events that occurred following the earthquakes of September 2010 and February 2011. The programme is underpinned by a Consortium of 11 national cultural heritage and research agencies‚ and employs 5 full-time employees devoted to the archiving process. Governance comprises a Programme Board‚ and a Research Committee chaired by the Dean of Postgraduate Research and including representation from the Human Ethics Committee. 85‚000 items have been archived to date‚ including a wide range of video‚ audio‚ and documentary material. In many ways the UC CEISMIC Archive is an excellent example of best practice in digital archiving‚ and has been recognized as such by several high-profile international teams. The programme team has been contacted by researchers and government agencies from Europe‚ North America‚ and Japan‚ confronting similar problems of scale and complexity‚ and looking for models to underpin their work. 
Conversations are underway about Phase 2 development of the archive‚ designed to leverage the existing governance model and systems in order to produce a national asset for post-disaster archiving‚ research‚ and pre-preparedness.

TI  - Data Integration in Canterbury: Lessons Learned from the CEISMIC Archive
AU  - Smithies, James

AB  - The UC CEISMIC Digital Archive was established in 2011 to identify, archive, and make publically accessible digital content related to the events that occurred following the earthquakes of September 2010 and February 2011. The programme is underpinned by a Consortium of 11 national cultural heritage and research agencies, and employs 5 full-time employees devoted to the archiving process. Governance comprises a Programme Board, and a Research Committee chaired by the Dean of Postgraduate Research and including representation from the Human Ethics Committee. 85,000 items have been archived to date, including a wide range of video, audio, and documentary material. In many ways the UC CEISMIC Archive is an excellent example of best practice in digital archiving, and has been recognized as such by several high-profile international teams. The programme team has been contacted by researchers and government agencies from Europe, North America, and Japan, confronting similar problems of scale and complexity, and looking for models to underpin their work. 
Conversations are underway about Phase 2 development of the archive, designed to leverage the existing governance model and systems in order to produce a national asset for post-disaster archiving, research, and pre-preparedness.  The goal is to ensure a broad view is taken of data archiving requirements in the Canterbury context, with a view to developing a platform capable of enabling a wide range of future research in not only the arts, social sciences, and humanities, but engineering, health, geography, business, and data science. Lessons from UC CEISMIC suggest that enabling such a platform is less an issue of technical systems, as of governance and political will. This talk will outline the opportunities for data integration, archiving, and research identified by the UC CEISMIC Programme, outline the real-world issues that make those opportunities difficult to leverage, and suggest approaches that might allow positive forward movement over the crucial period from 2015 – 2017.

On September 4 2010 a magnitude 7.1 quake struck at 4.35 am‚ causing widespread damage and two serious injuries. Significant aftershock sequences followed. On February 22 2011 a 6.3 magnitude quake hit at 12.51 pm. This earthquake caused severe damage and resulted in the loss of 181 lives‚ making it the second worst natural disaster in New Zealand history. Like the first‚ the second quake has been followed by thousands of aftershocks‚ including two significant earthquakes on June 13th 2011.
The University of Canterbury CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive draws on the example of the Centre for History and New Media’s (CHNM) September 11 Archive‚ which was used to collect digital artefacts after the bombing of the World Trade Centre buildings in 2001‚ but has gone significantly further than this project in its development as a federated digital archive. The new University of Canterbury Digital Humanities Programme – initiated to build the archive – has gathered together a Consortium of major national organizations to contribute content to a federated archive based on principles of openness and collaboration derived directly from the international digital humanities community. Two primary archive ‘nodes’ have been built by the Ministry of Culture and Heritage (‘QuakeStories’) and the University of Canterbury (‘QuakeStudies’) to collect content from the public and researchers respectively‚ and a ‘front window (www.ceismic.org.nz) has been provided by the University of Canterbury to bond the Consortium‚ raise funds‚ and provide a platform for future aggregated search functions‚ which will be powered by New Zealand’s bespoke cultural heritage schema maintained by Digital NZ. Other nodes in the federation include The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa‚ the National Library‚ Christchurch City Libraries‚ NZ On Screen‚ and the Canterbury Museum. The aim is to create a permanent record of digital objects for both present and future generations. To this end the technical requirements for QuakeStudies have been reviewed by the National Digital Heritage Archive with a view to ingesting significant subsets of content (if not creating a complete dark archive) for long-term preservation. Significant attention has been paid during the design process to multi-cultural and multi-lingual requirements‚ to ensure content from a broad range of New Zealand communities can be ingested and researched. Future development aims to create a bi-lingual interface in English and Māori.
The story behind the UC CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive goes somewhat further than other similar digital archives. Not only is it being used to initiate New Zealand’s first Digital Humanities programme‚ but it hopes to fulfil an important role in the cultural and intellectual recovery of the Canterbury region following the earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. New Zealand is a country with significant levels of technology uptake‚ and the vast majority of content produced following the earthquakes was created in digital form. As the central focus of the recovery efforts was‚ of necessity‚ focussed on the physical and spiritual well-being of the Canterbury public‚ it was quite possible that large amounts of valuable content would be lost to future generations. This altered somewhat after the initial phase of critical response ended‚ only to be replaced with new issues. Various institutions began gathering digital content into their separate repositories‚ but no co-ordinated approach was taken‚ creating a situation where disparate ‘nodes’ of content might be stored with little possibility of sharing and reuse. It was becoming possible that‚ although terabytes of content would be captured‚ future generations of citizens and researchers would need to go to myriad different archives‚ each with their own metadata standards‚ in order to get a complete picture of events. Aside from the obvious inconvenience of this‚ such a situation would seriously constrain the possibility of sophisticated downstream data analysis and content reuse. 
The digital humanities ethos of sharing and open collaboration has had a significant positive effect in this context. Consistent recourse to the digital humanities’ message of collaboration has fostered a culture of trust that has in turn allowed an extremely broad Consortium to be initiated. Although there is little chance that the resulting federation will be technically seamless‚ this has allowed potential conflicts of interest to be put aside and technical discussions to start at a relatively early stage in proceedings‚ significantly enhancing the chances of developing a highly functional distributed archive. Additionally‚ the digital humanities’ emphasis on open communication and community engagement has fostered a healthy culture across the federation‚ which has contributed significantly to the success of the project. This is represented most forcefully in the use of not only crowd-sourcing techniques‚ but a mobile recording studio fitted out with video and audio equipment‚ that has been taken to the suburbs of Christchurch to record public reaction to the earthquakes. This pro-active approach‚ coupled with robust attention to project structure‚ governance and human ethics‚ has created not only a digital archive‚ but a community of friends and partners‚ and a vibrant new digital humanities programme.
The project is also unusual for a digital humanities project in it becoming a flagship project for the broader university. Although the project and research teams are predominantly from the arts and humanities‚ close collaboration is also occurring with computer scientists‚ health researchers‚ social scientists and economists. As with the interest from New Zealand’s national heritage agencies‚ digital humanities principles of collaboration and sharing‚ combined with well-considered metadata ontologies and system architecture‚ has prompted the project to occupy a central position in the post-earthquake recovery landscape. More than just an IT project‚ the CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive is providing local‚ national and international public and researchers with a forum for discussion‚ organization and collaboration as well as a heritage asset in itself. 
This paper will outline the project and present a model that will hopefully allow our approach to be reproduced in similar post-disaster recovery situations. Key to this model is the conscious use of digital humanities methodologies such as crowd-sourcing‚ community building and attention to open metadata ontologies and open access principles to create a robust and functional federated archive system. The model has several benefits‚ including the ability to develop a ‘distributed nodal network’ of archives and repositories independently‚ thus reducing the need for centralisation that would encumber development‚ but it requires a long-term vision and a strong governance framework to ensure the federation holds together and organizations feel comfortable sharing content. Similarly‚ while it offers excellent potential for teaching and research across the humanities as a whole‚ the relatively advanced nature of the project provides limited opportunity to involve students in system development. Instead‚ the project has created internships that will see students working as ‘curators’ on the research node in the federation‚ uploading content and taking responsibility for metadata quality and the integrity of manual procedures.</div></div></div><div class="blink"><a href="http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz:80/handle/10092/10687">source</a></div><div class="blink"><a href="javascript:show(this);" onclick="show(this);">bib</a><div class="bibshowhide"><div class="bib">@inproceedings{smithies_federated_2012,

The story behind the UC CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive goes somewhat further than other similar digital archives. Not only is it being used to initiate New Zealand’s first Digital Humanities programme, but it hopes to fulfil an important role in the cultural and intellectual recovery of the Canterbury region following the earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. New Zealand is a country with significant levels of technology uptake, and the vast majority of content produced following the earthquakes was created in digital form. As the central focus of the recovery efforts was, of necessity, focussed on the physical and spiritual well-being of the Canterbury public, it was quite possible that large amounts of valuable content would be lost to future generations. This altered somewhat after the initial phase of critical response ended, only to be replaced with new issues. Various institutions began gathering digital content into their separate repositories, but no co-ordinated approach was taken, creating a situation where disparate ‘nodes’ of content might be stored with little possibility of sharing and reuse. It was becoming possible that, although terabytes of content would be captured, future generations of citizens and researchers would need to go to myriad different archives, each with their own metadata standards, in order to get a complete picture of events. Aside from the obvious inconvenience of this, such a situation would seriously constrain the possibility of sophisticated downstream data analysis and content reuse. 
The digital humanities ethos of sharing and open collaboration has had a significant positive effect in this context. Consistent recourse to the digital humanities’ message of collaboration has fostered a culture of trust that has in turn allowed an extremely broad Consortium to be initiated. Although there is little chance that the resulting federation will be technically seamless, this has allowed potential conflicts of interest to be put aside and technical discussions to start at a relatively early stage in proceedings, significantly enhancing the chances of developing a highly functional distributed archive. Additionally, the digital humanities’ emphasis on open communication and community engagement has fostered a healthy culture across the federation, which has contributed significantly to the success of the project. This is represented most forcefully in the use of not only crowd-sourcing techniques, but a mobile recording studio fitted out with video and audio equipment, that has been taken to the suburbs of Christchurch to record public reaction to the earthquakes. This pro-active approach, coupled with robust attention to project structure, governance and human ethics, has created not only a digital archive, but a community of friends and partners, and a vibrant new digital humanities programme.
The project is also unusual for a digital humanities project in it becoming a flagship project for the broader university. Although the project and research teams are predominantly from the arts and humanities, close collaboration is also occurring with computer scientists, health researchers, social scientists and economists. As with the interest from New Zealand’s national heritage agencies, digital humanities principles of collaboration and sharing, combined with well-considered metadata ontologies and system architecture, has prompted the project to occupy a central position in the post-earthquake recovery landscape. More than just an IT project, the CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquake Digital Archive is providing local, national and international public and researchers with a forum for discussion, organization and collaboration as well as a heritage asset in itself. 
This paper will outline the project and present a model that will hopefully allow our approach to be reproduced in similar post-disaster recovery situations. Key to this model is the conscious use of digital humanities methodologies such as crowd-sourcing, community building and attention to open metadata ontologies and open access principles to create a robust and functional federated archive system. The model has several benefits, including the ability to develop a ‘distributed nodal network’ of archives and repositories independently, thus reducing the need for centralisation that would encumber development, but it requires a long-term vision and a strong governance framework to ensure the federation holds together and organizations feel comfortable sharing content. Similarly, while it offers excellent potential for teaching and research across the humanities as a whole, the relatively advanced nature of the project provides limited opportunity to involve students in system development. Instead, the project has created internships that will see students working as ‘curators’ on the research node in the federation, uploading content and taking responsibility for metadata quality and the integrity of manual procedures.

AB  - Stevan Eldred-Grigg's (1952-) writing spans the uneasy divide between history and literature. Always provocative, his publications have tended to polarise opinion. Despite his considerable contribution to New Zealand letters, he is a figure who has never been accepted with equanimity by professional historians and literary critics.
