Sometimes they represent an attempt to answer a specific research question. Sometimes the goal is to contribute to a local, national, or international community. They often involve collaborations with colleagues, software vendors, IT support staff, and team members with considerably more technical skills than I have. The results are variable. I make no claim that the digital humanities are radically transformative or always useful for teaching or research; the digital arts, social sciences, and humanities remain a work in progress. I have a strong preference for open source technologies.

The purpose is less about rejecting the many excellent online services available to humanities researchers, and more about embracing the possibilities inherent in our contemporary global computing ecosystem: a system that remains heterogenous and empowering even as it trends towards commercialism, and governmental command and control. In that sense full-stack DH is an attempt to remind us that technical knowledge can be empowering as well as exclusionary, and that architectural choices can create products that align well to our older traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from initally using a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Raspberry Pi</a> minimal computer, the open source technology used is all commercial-grade and capable of scaling up to support extraordinary levels of demand. While such technologies do not completely circumvent issues associated with the technology industry, they align well to scholarly values inherited from the humanities and social science traditions. They are also well suited to research contexts that require verifiability, falsification, and reproducibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Django</a> web framework - developed to support large newspaper sites - has been used for web development. Django is an open source project written in Python, a language frequently used to teach programming, and widely used in academic research in the social sciences, hard sciences, engineering, and the humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site has been built by an amateur programmer.

        "body": "<h4>Background</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mashape.com/\">https://www.mashape.com/</a>&nbsp;offers Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that perform common text analysis tasks, including the one we&rsquo;ll use for this tutorial:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition\">Named Entity Recognition</a>&nbsp;(NER). Text analysis is a good way to introduce students to data mining. You can use text documents, or a URL.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Purpose</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To introduce non-technical historians and students to data mining. The idea is to present students with a purposefully naive example of data mining, working on the assumption it&rsquo;ll prompt them to critically engage with data mining as a method. The questions they explore are in many ways more important than the results you present them with.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Step 1: Get the NER results</h4>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"1\">\r\n\t<li>Go to the&nbsp;Fordham Modern History Sourcebook and find a document that works for your class. After blindly clicking I&rsquo;ve chosen &lsquo;Instructions for the Virginia Colony 1606&rsquo;. Copy the URL.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sign up to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mashape.com/\">Mashup</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Go to the Mashape&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mashape.com/aylien/text-analysis\">text analysis API</a>. Scroll down until you find the Named Entity Recognition tool,&nbsp;copy your document URL into the appropriate field and click Test Endpoint.</li>\r\n\t<li>At this point you&rsquo;ll need to enter credit card details. Be sure to subscribe to their &lsquo;Freemium&rsquo; service! After your credit card has been accepted click Subscribe. You&rsquo;ll be returned to the Text Analysis API page.</li>\r\n\t<li>Scroll back down to the&nbsp;Named Entity Recognition tool,&nbsp;copy your document URL into the appropriate field again and click Test Endpoint.</li>\r\n\t<li>The results of the query will appear. Copy this (I&rsquo;ve included my results below). You could get your students to sign up for the service and generate the results themselves, but since a credit card is required it&rsquo;s probably better to just provide it for them. At any rate, this is the content of your tutorial.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h4>Step 2: Produce some questions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>So, entity extraction for historians &ndash; useful? Yes, but. If you&rsquo;ve got a body of thousands of documents (or millions of emails, perhaps), it can give you an idea of the type of content and tone of the corpus etc. It might be useful to test commonly held opinions about a given document or corpus that were formed when people could only read a subset because of time / labour constraints. In some cases the document set might simply be too large to analyse manually. It can also help to develop secondary websites that present the content using maps and timelines, or enrich online publications with contextual links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different data mining algorithms offer different perspectives, of course. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), for example, returns common topics.&nbsp;The algorithms tend to have been developed for the sciences, so they work well with factual prose, but increasingly poorly the more subjective the text gets (although those cases result in interesting unexpected results anyway). Data mining algorithms benefit from &lsquo;training&rsquo; , so the results below are fairly raw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions for students are obvious enough:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"1\">\r\n\t<li>&lsquo;Are you confident that the source document used in this tutorial is adequate for our analysis? How could we ensure it&rsquo;s a perfect copy of the original?&rsquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&lsquo;How useful is data mining to historians?&rsquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&lsquo;Is data mining using an algorithm superior or inferior to manual approaches?&rsquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&lsquo;Should you draw any conclusions from the results without understanding what the data mining algorithm is designed to do?&rsquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&lsquo;Do the results suggest a fully successful analysis, or do some things need tweaking?&rsquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&lsquo;What are the implications of using a machine and algorithms to conduct historical research?&rsquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&lsquo;Will these techniques ever render historians redundant?&rsquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>&lsquo;Does it mean students should be being taught how algorithms work, so humanists aren&rsquo;t reliant on ones designed for scientists?&rsquo;.</li>\r\n\t<li>etc</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h4>Step 3: Further Reading</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Named Entity Recognition and History</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">Crane, Gregory, and Alison Jones. &ldquo;<a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4119094\">The Challenge of Virginia Banks: An Evaluation of Named Entity Analysis in a 19th-Century Newspaper Collection</a>.&rdquo; In&nbsp;<em>Proceedings of the 6th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries</em>, 31&ndash;40.

In the first decade of the seventeenth century England began a second round of colonizing attempts. This time jointstock companies were used as the vehicle to plant settlements rather than giving extensive grants to a landed proprietor such as Gilbert or Raleigh, whose attempts at colonization in the 1570s and 1580s had failed. The founding of Virginia marked the beginning of a twenty-five year period in which every colony in the New World was established by means of a joint-stock company. A variety of motives intensified the colonizing impulse &ndash; international rivalry, propagation of religion, enlarged opportunity for individual men &ndash; but none exceeded that of trade and profit. The companies were created to make a profit; their in vestments in the colonies were based on this assumption. Early in the 1630&rsquo;s merchants and investors discovered that they could employ their money in other more rewarding enterprises. After 1631, therefore, no colony was founded by mercantile enterprise, but by that date the enterprisers had left a legacy of colonization that was to endure. In these instructions for the Virginia Company, the power of Spain and the fear derived from past failures invade every line. The detail and precision of the instructions reflect the work of experienced men; Richard Hakluyt, the younger, for example, probably had a hand in writing them.&nbsp; As we doubt not but you will have especial care to observe the ordinances set down by the King&rsquo;s Majesty and delivered unto you under the Privy Seal; so for your better directions upon your first landing we have thought good to recommend unto your care these instructions and articles following.&nbsp; When it shall please God to send you on the coast of Virginia, you shall do your best endeavour to find out a safe port in the entrance of some navigable river, making choice of such a one as runneth farthest into the land, and if you happen to discover divers portable rivers, and amongst them any one that hath two main branches, if the difference be not great, make choice of that which bendeth most toward the North-West for that way you shall soonest find the other sea.&nbsp; When you have made choice of the river on which you mean to settle, be not hasty in landing your victuals and munitions; but first let Captain Newport discover how far that river may be found navigable, that you make election of the strongest, most wholesome and fertile place; for if you make many removes, besides the loss of time, you shall greatly spoil your victuals and your caske, and with great pain transport it in small boats.&nbsp; But if you choose your place so far up as a bark of fifty tuns will float, then you may lay all your provisions ashore with ease, and the better receive the trade of all the countries about you in the land; and such a place you may perchance find a hundred miles from the river&rsquo;s mouth, and the further up the better. For if you sit down near the entrance, except it be in some island that is strong by nature, an enemy that may approach you on even ground, may easily pull you out; and if he be driven to seek you a hundred miles [in] the land in boats, you shall from both sides of the river where it is narrowest, so beat them with your muskets as they shall never be able to prevail against you.&nbsp; And to the end that you be not surprised as the French were in Florida by Melindus, and the Spaniard in the same place by the French, you shall do well to make this double provision. First, erect a little stoure at the mouth of the river that may lodge some ten men; with whom you shall leave a light boat, that when any fleet shall be in sight, they may come with speed to give you warning. Secondly, you must in no case suffer any of the native people of the country to inhabit between you and the sea coast; for you cannot carry yourselves so towards them, but they will grow discontented with your habitation, and be ready to guide and assist any nation that shall come to invade you; and if you neglect this, you neglect your safety.&nbsp; When you have discovered as far up the river as you mean to plant yourselves, and landed your victuals and munitions; to the end that every man may know his charge, you shall do well to divide your six score men into three parts; whereof one party of them you may appoint to fortifie and build, of which your first work must be your storehouse for victuals; the other you may imploy in preparing your ground and sowing your corn and roots; the other ten of these forty you must leave as centinel at the haven&rsquo;s mouth. The other forty you may imploy for two months in discovery of the river above you, and on the country about you; which charge Captain Newport and Captain Gosnold may undertake of these forty discoverers. When they do espie any high lands or hills, Captain Gosnold may take twenty of the company to cross over the lands, and carrying a half dozen pickaxes to try if they can find any minerals. The other twenty may go on by river, and pitch up boughs upon the bank&rsquo;s side, by which the other boats shall follow them by the same turnings. You may also take with them a wherry, such as is used here in the Thames; by which you may send back to the President for supply of munition or any other want, that you may not be driven to return for every small defect.&nbsp; You must observe if you can, whether the river on which you plant doth spring out of mountains or out of lakes. If it be out of any lake, the passage to the other sea will be more easy, and [it] is like enough, that out of the same lake you shall find some spring which run[s] the contrary way towards the East India Sea; for the great and famous rivers of Volga, Tan[a]is and Dwina have three heads near joynd; and yet the one falleth into the Caspian Sea, the other into the Euxine Sea, and the third into the Paelonian Sea.&nbsp; In all your passages you must have great care not to offend the naturals [natives], if you can eschew it; and imploy some few of your company to trade with them for corn and all other . . . victuals if you have any; and this you must do before that they perceive you mean to plant among them; for not being sure how your own seed corn will prosper the first year, to avoid the danger of famine, use and endeavour to store yourselves of the country corn.&nbsp; Your discoverers that pass over land with hired guides, must look well to them that they slip not from them: and for more assurance, let them take a compass with them, and write down how far they go upon every point of the compass; for that country having no way nor path, if that your guides run from you in the great woods or desert, you shall hardly ever find a passage back.&nbsp; And how weary soever your soldiers be, let them never trust the country people with the carriage of their weapons; for if they run from you with your shott, which they only fear, they will easily kill them all with their arrows. And whensoever any of yours shoots before them, be sure they may be chosen out of your best marksmen; for if they see your learners miss what they aim at, they will think the weapon not so terrible, and thereby will be bould to assault you.&nbsp; Above all things, do not advertize the killing of any of your men, that the country people may know it; if they perceive that they are but common men, and that with the loss of many of theirs they diminish any part of yours, they will make many adventures upon you. If the country be populous, you shall do well also, not to let them see or know of your sick men, if you have any; which may also encourage them to many enterprizes.&nbsp; You must take especial care that you choose a seat for habitation that shall not be over burthened with woods near your town; for all the men you have, shall not be able to cleanse twenty acres a year; besides that it may serve for a covert for your enemies round about.&nbsp; Neither must you plant in a low or moist place, because it will prove unhealthfull. You shall judge of the good air by the people; for some part of that coast where the lands are low, have their people blear eyed, and with swollen bellies and legs; but if the naturals be strong and clean made, it is a true sign of a wholesome soil.&nbsp; You must take order to draw up the pinnace that is left with you, under the fort: and take her sails and anchors ashore, all but a small kedge to ride by; least some ill-dispositioned persons slip away with her.&nbsp; You must take care that your marriners that go for wages, do not mar your trade; for those that mind not to inhabite, for a little gain will debase the estimation of exchange, and hinder the trade for ever after; and therefore you shall not admit or suffer any person whatsoever, other than such as shall be appointed by the President and Counsel there, to buy any merchandizes or other things whatsoever.&nbsp; It were necessary that all your carpenters and other such like workmen about building do first build your storehouse and those other rooms of publick and necessary use before any house be set up for any private person: and though the workman may belong to any private persons yet let them all work together first for the company and then for private men.&nbsp; And seeing order is at the same price with confusion, it shall be adviseably done to set your houses even and by a line, that your street may have a good breadth, and be carried square about your market place and every street&rsquo;s end opening into it; that from thence, with a few field pieces, you may command every street throughout; which market place you may also fortify if you think it needfull.&nbsp; You shall do well to send a perfect relation by Captaine Newport of all that is done, what height you are seated, how far into the land, what commodities you find, what soil, woods and their several kinds, and so of all other things else to advertise particularly; and to suffer no man to return but by pasport from the President and Counsel, nor to write any letter of anything that may discourage others.&nbsp; Lastly and chiefly the way to prosper and achieve good success is to make yourselves all of one mind for the good of your country and your own, and to serve and fear God the Giver of all Goodness, for every plantation which our Heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted out.&rdquo;,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;entities&rdquo;: {</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;location&rdquo;:

        "body": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the now relatively long-standing debate in Digital Humanities about &lsquo;who&rsquo;s in and who&rsquo;s out&rsquo; and wondering if there&rsquo;s an angle we haven&rsquo;t been considering (by writing &lsquo;we&rsquo; this makes an assumption I&rsquo;m &lsquo;in&rsquo;, of course, which I have to admit feels both presumptive given there&rsquo;s a chance I don&rsquo;t fit someone else&rsquo;s criteria and odd given I&rsquo;m a Senior Lecturer in Digital Humanities). My suggestion is that we need to stop <em>only</em> thinking about the specific technical skills a digital humanist needs, and consider the function the (extra)discipline plays in the broader community, as well as the role(s) it is likely to need to play in the future. It&rsquo;s becoming clearer, even to a natural pessimist like myself, that humanists are only going to build more digital tools, methods and services as the years progress. I&rsquo;m contacted fairly regularly by people considering starting digital projects but unsure either how to start or what standards are expected. In New Zealand, if they were building a house, they might contact a Master Builder &ndash; a builder accredited by a trade organisation that the customer can trust will either do a good job or be held accountable (to some degree) if they don&rsquo;t. Often they&rsquo;ll coordinate subcontractors like plumbers and electricians, to make sure everyone does a good job at the right time, or work with a project manager performing that role. Some Master Builders might be old hands who built houses for years but are now a bit creaky and prefer to manage teams of younger builders who do the work under their guidance. The younger builders (quite possibly accredited themselves) are probably keen on the flash new materials and techniques, and possibly more up to date than their older colleague, but as their elder and better he would probably be the person you&rsquo;d prefer to go to in a pinch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s my point? My point is that there might be a layer on top of the list of DH skills you need to display to be &lsquo;in&rsquo;, and that layer might be almost as important as the list itself. If our practice is to be useful to our peers, they (humanities students, teachers and researchers, and perhaps cultural heritage and influences professionals who haven&rsquo;t done much digital work) need to know i] Who to contact if they&rsquo;re interested in developing a digital project to good standards and ii] That the person they&rsquo;re talking to will &ndash; if they can&rsquo;t do it themselves for whatever reason &ndash; guide them in the right direction. What characteristics might a &lsquo;card carrying&rsquo; (that could be a weird idea) DHer exhibit, in no particular order?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Membership in ADHO or a Constituent Organisation, and evidence of participation in ADHO or CO events, THATCamps etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>An awarenes of the range of digital tools, methods and services used across the digital humanities community, and the standards required for them. (The layer underneath this is obviously crucially important, but it will shift over the decades and is best discussed within the community, as regularly happens and will hopefully never stop. Geoffrey Rockwell&rsquo;s suggestions in a recent edition of Humanist prompted this post to some degree, leading to this list overlapping in places).</li>\r\n\t<li>A degree in the humanities, a record of ongoing engagement with one or more fields, and an understanding of the broad intellectual terrain.</li>\r\n\t<li>Evidence of publication in quality scholarly publications. (This one is difficult. It&rsquo;s important to indicate an understanding of traditional scholarly norms and an ability to implement them to trade standard, but I don&rsquo;t want to give the impression I&rsquo;m referring to a narrow range of traditional analog academic publishing options. It&rsquo;s also debatable, because I know of several people who I doubt have published but I respect very highly as digital humanists. What I can say is that if it isn&rsquo;t a current expectation it probably will be in the future, at least for practising within universities.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Experience building and consulting on digital humanities projects.</li>\r\n\t<li>An understanding of project management methodologies and software development best practices.</li>\r\n\t<li>An understanding of the requirements digital archiving, preservation, and data management present.</li>\r\n\t<li>An awareness of local and international funding agencies, and an understanding of how to gain funding for digital projects.</li>\r\n\t<li>An awareness of the history of digital humanities and humanities computing.</li>\r\n\t<li>An awareness of significant digital humanities projects and key people in the local and international communities.</li>\r\n\t<li>Engagement with the digital humanities community via trade publications, social media, and online seminars.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Update (a fairly fundamental oversight, actually):</strong> Understanding and support for community values like the importance of learning to code, inclusiveness, egalitarianism,&nbsp;and the broader DIY ethos.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Lists like this are sometimes embarassingly self-serving, but you get the idea. I guess it boils down to the fact that I&rsquo;m more concerned about the type of person someone gets when they make that phonecall to engage a digital humanist than the specific skills that DHer might have. If we (only) try to legislate for a narrow range of skills we&rsquo;ll find ourselves in the same position computer scientists did in the 1960s, when Ceruzzi notes there were heated debates about who could call themselves a &lsquo;computer programmer&rsquo; or not. The rate of change was so great back then that every time they identified a skill requirement another would pop up.<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Although defining a list of trade skills is crucial for training purposes, it&rsquo;s possibly more important to ensure people who represent themselves as DHers are capable of guiding our colleagues in the right direction. Let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s quite conceivable that someone could engage an expert in TEI or topic modelling and get very poor advice for their digital project on 3D modelling of paper ships. What would be worse for our community: that someone who doesn&rsquo;t have a specific skill represents us well, or that someone with it makes us all look bad?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>References</u></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>P.E.

Perhaps I should also note that readers from New Zealand, Australia, and other ex-commonwealth nations (as well as Britain) might find it bemusing. The backstory is that I&rsquo;m writing to a North American audience on a topic specific to the digital humanities. Here goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I saw <a href=\"http://dhpoco.org/\" target=\"_blank\">#dhpoco</a> announced I couldn&rsquo;t get info about it fast enough. My formative intellectual years were spent saturated in postcolonial discourse and I was eager to see it imported into the digital humanities. New Zealand during the 1980s (my childhood) and 1990s (my undergraduate and postgraduate years) was dominated by it. To me it represents the only weapon I&rsquo;ve had in arguments with racists who abused indigenous people, who complained about the official acknowledgements of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi\" target=\"_blank\">Treaty of Waitangi</a>, who perpetuated historic wrongs. I eventually wrote about postcolonialism in New Zealand in <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/15741899/James-Smithies-Imagining-New-Zealand-2002\" target=\"_blank\">my doctoral thesis</a>, in a chapter on Keri Hulme, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Bone-People-A-Novel/dp/0140089225\" target=\"_blank\">The Bone People </a>(1984). Postcolonialism underpins what I think is an increasingly (although by no means completely) honourable relationship between Maori and Pakeha, backed by our political and legal system. It provides the intellectual ammunition required to &ndash; ever so slowly and inadequately &ndash; begin to roll back 150 years of colonial domination. And the job isn&rsquo;t finished yet, by a long stretch. It never will be. A professor down the corridor from me has written a postcolonial book called <a href=\"http://books.google.co.nz/books/about/The_long_forgetting.html?id=R84LAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" target=\"_blank\">The Long Forgetting</a>, pointing out in ascerbic terms the way we&rsquo;ve managed as a country to forget what happened on our islands, largely in the interests of middle-class geniality. And of course New Zealanders didn&rsquo;t come up with this approach to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonialism\" target=\"_blank\">postcolonialism</a> on our own. It was informed by theorists across the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonialism#Post-colonial_nations\" target=\"_blank\">postcolonial world</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so to our beloved postcolonial world. My first reaction to seeing what #dhpoco stood for was &ndash; understandably according to the colleagues I&rsquo;ve spoken to &ndash; to recoil in confusion. It didn&rsquo;t represent anything I understood postcolonialism to be, or speak to the postcolonial world(s) I know. Critical Theory, yes. A <a href=\"http://dhpoco.org/blog/2013/05/10/open-thread-the-digital-humanities-as-a-historical-refuge-from-raceclassgendersexualitydisability/\" target=\"_blank\">powerful melange</a> of identity theory and feminisms, queer theories and activist politics, but not &lsquo;my&rsquo; postcolonialism. Frankly, my first thought was &lsquo;The US is colonising postcolonialism!&rsquo; In the context of recent US invasions of the (actual geographic) postcolonial world this apparent intellectual appropriation was jarring, to say the least. Coupled with what less charitable people view as a global programme of US cultural colonisation it felt at best wrong-headed and at worst an example of (unconscious) neo-colonialism. The baser side of me initally concluded it was simply the intellectual follow-on to Bush&rsquo;s adventures; an inevitable smothering of postcolonialism by the only remaining superpower. Domination by intellectual appropriation. Then I wondered if maybe I needed to catch up on my reading, that in my years away from academe postcolonial discourse had radically altered. Wikipedia and fleeting conversations with some random colleagues suggested this isn&rsquo;t the case, leaving me with the view that all I&rsquo;m seeing is a provincial (I don&rsquo;t mean that in a pejorative way) US instantiation of the term that requires localization for New Zealand (and probably Australia and the rest of the postcolonial world). Heavy stuff, then, but not overly problematic. I&rsquo;d be being dishonest if I didn&rsquo;t admit that #dhpoco prompted a rather hearty WTF when I first realised what it represented, but after more thought I&rsquo;ve realised all it might actually show is how ignorant I am about US cultural politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s reset things. At the risk of appearing hopelessly passive aggressive, rather than merely confused, I want to go on the record by noting that #dhpoco is a wonderful thing, to be celebrated and encouraged. I agree with its values wholeheartedly. DH is largely populated by white, male, straight people. This has to change. Bravo. And as a Pakeha male what right do I have to either speak for indiginous people in my part of the world, or criticize marginal groups overseas engaged in a struggle for their own empowerment? Moreover, on reflection I can see how the antipodean version of postcolonialism might seem a bit radical, a bit exclusive, from the #dhpoco perspective. When a New Zealander thinks about poco in terms of the US, after all, the only possible beneficiaries are Native Americans. Postcolonialism is <em>their</em> tool, the only real tool they have to empower themselves and gain greater legal and political representation. It is inconceivable, in antipodean terms, that a white woman (for instance) would be able to use that tool for her own purposes. But there&rsquo;s the rub. The differences between #dhpoco and postcolonialism Down Under hinge around 2 issues: timing and the relationship of postcolonialism to intersectionality. The colonisation process started so much earlier in North America, and was so far advanced by the time postcolonialism appeared in the post World War Two era, that Native Americans (apparently &ndash; my ignorance might show here, as elsewhere in this post) weren&rsquo;t able to claim it for themselves. &lsquo;All&rsquo; they seem to have gotten (from our antipodean persepective) was the critical theory that went with it. They have to share the most powerful critical tool available to them, in a radically intersectional political and cultural context. New Zealand intellectuals have resisted going down that path because &ndash; even though it makes sense in some ways &ndash; it would dilute the movement towards postcolonial empowerment for the people that (our) postcolonialism is designed for: colonised people. While there&rsquo;s an acceptance that the rights of indigenous people to self-determination and political power intersects in fundamentally important ways with the needs of other marginalised groups, that they are natural allies and in many cases people will be marginalised as a result of more than one aspect of their identity, this does not change the fact that a gay man, say, is one of the colonisers rather than colonised. To assert otherwise would be deeply offensive in anything other than purely intellectual terms, wherein the basic critical precepts that exposed colonialism for what it is are generalised in the service of a broader emancipatory project. But even that wouldn&rsquo;t be news, or viewed as culturally appropriate in most circles. I can say that with some surity because we&rsquo;ve been having these discussions since the 1970s and I tackled them in my doctoral thesis in relation to a national debate sparked by Keri Hulme&rsquo;s assertions of what would now be termed &lsquo;intersectional&rsquo; identity politics. The intellectual ground is deep, broad, and riven with hidden chasms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, time to get out the toolkit: some localization is needed. In fact, it&rsquo;s urgently needed because we need to ensure that indigenous peoples in our part of the world get to engage with DH as colonised people and have the full benefit of our local postcolonial discourse(s) when they do. The fact is that we&rsquo;re far enough behind the rest of the world with DH that our indigenous cultures haven&rsquo;t had a chance to engage with it yet. Ignoring the work that happens in cultural heritage organisations, it&rsquo;s still a white middle-class activity. I politely submit, and stand to be corrected by someone more schooled in (non-US) postcolonial politics than me, that we reserve the term &lsquo;postcolonialism&rsquo; in our part of the world for the cultures who suffered the effects of nineteenth century colonisation and its ongoing associated processes: give them a chance to engage with the digital world on their own terms and in their own time. Let <em>them</em> own postcolonial DH discourse and determine its future in our part of the world. In fact, why not just park it for a while until more appropriate voices than mine can speak up. Maybe they&rsquo;ll choose to interpret things differently to me. All I can say is that I&rsquo;m not entirely confident speaking on behalf of all New Zealanders (and perhaps by implication Australians and people in other postcolonial nations) but am equally uncomfortable with the idea that we might undermine indigenous peoples&rsquo; future intellectual (not to mention political and cultural) agency if digital humanities is developed without an effort to localize its #dhpoco aspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#dhpoco in the antipodes, then, translates (to me at least) as #criticaldh. I run that code in my head whenever I engage with it now. It allows me to support #dhpoco and to draw out aspects of it that will be of huge value to postcolonial cultures when and if they do begin to engage with DH. I can see fundamentally important areas of mutual interest: Critical examination of video games like Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization, archiving and preservation issues related to precious cultural heritage artefacts, copyright and licensing, encoding standards, data modelling, the use of GIS to aid historical understanding, language localization, the development of AI to represent non-Western consciousness&hellip;.the list is endless. Many of the skills and attitudes needed to engage with these topics in a sophisticated way are being developed within the #dhpoco movement, and it&rsquo;s crucially important that work continues, but it&rsquo;s equally important we develop grassroots expertise in our region so we can contribute our own hard-won perspectives. I&rsquo;ve more thinking to do about this, and hope to produce something more structured, formal, and code-related but I hope it suffices to add one additional caveat to this post &ndash; proof that I&rsquo;ve been mulling over these issues for some time. Three years ago I wrote a post called <a href=\"http://jamessmithies.org/blog/2010/12/05/digital-humanities-the-pacific-node/\" target=\"_blank\">The Pacific Node</a>, where I finished with:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#555555\"><span style=\"font-family:museo-sans-1,museo-sans-2,sans-serif\">There&rsquo;s an element of post-colonialism in this conception of a Pacific-centered digital humanities node, of course. As much as the international digital humanities community are gregariously interested in new ideas and encouraging of equal participation on all levels and by all groups, they cannot conceive of our local needs, because we haven&rsquo;t articulated them yet. We need to formulate those needs and then engage with colleagues outside the Pacific to bring a new, digital, vision to reality.</span></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The work to build a Pacific Node has hardly started, but I&rsquo;d like to think the idea represents what the places Down Under have always offered the northern hemisphere: antipodal perspectives.</p>",

        "body": "<p><em>This is the text of a talk given at eResearch 2013, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, July 03, 2013.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can only offer a very formative overview of this subject here, but I&rsquo;m keen to at least put it on the radar. As everyone knows, vast amounts of our cultural heritage are either being digitized and put online or being born online, and this has significant implications for the arts and humanities. In particular, it forces us to start increasing our understanding of, and capability with, the engineered technologies that deliver resources to us online. It will always be difficult getting the balance right &ndash; we&rsquo;re never going to be engineers &ndash; but we need to start working through the issues. In this talk I&rsquo;ll give you a quick overview of the international context, try to convey something about what eResearch in the Humanities actually is, describe where we&rsquo;re at nationally, and suggest some very formative requirements that might help us work out what direction we need to go in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find myself complaining about how far behind the rest of the world we are in New Zealand, but sometimes I think I&rsquo;m being a bit harsh. Humanities Computing has been around for decades, and New Zealand researchers have never really taken a strong interest in it, but the development of humanities eResearch infrastructure is in its infancy everywhere. That said, the United States, United Kingdom, and to some extent Australia, have been building their capability (and their actual infrastructures) for some time now. New Zealand has basically the same component parts that could be used for a Humanities infrastructure as those countries, but the US, UK and Australia have benefited from ongoing strategic conversations that have allowed them to leverage their assets and develop roadmaps far better than we have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conversation in the US was given an additional prompt in 2006 with the American Council of Learned Societies&rsquo; report &ldquo;Our Cultural Commonwealth&rdquo; , which started to identify areas where requirements for the Humanities and Social Sciences differ from the hard sciences and engineering. This was in the context of the development of the HathiTrust Digital influences and mass digitization efforts by Google, Microsoft and the Internet Archive. In 2006 the US NEH established what came to be known as the Office of Digital Humanities, which has funneled significant amounts of funding into both digital humanities and infrastructure and capability-building projects. Australians often suggest they&rsquo;re behind the US and UK, but you&rsquo;ve just seen what fantastic work is happening with the HuNI project [the previous talk was by Richard Rothwell, from the Australian Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI) project]. Very few New Zealand humanists are even aware of HuNI, but I suspect they&rsquo;ll get a wake-up call when they realize what their Australian colleagues have available, especially if high quality research articles start being produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do humanities researchers need in terms of infrastructure? HuNI provides an excellent model for us, and in many ways I&rsquo;d suggest we should be modeling requirements for our infrastructure from them, but we need to think about the fundamentals for ourselves as well. This is because in broader terms &ndash; and this is why cultural change within our humanities research communities will be needed alongside improved infrastructure &ndash; we&rsquo;re talking about systems capable of supporting a fundamental change in the way *some humanities researchers* approach sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In brief, that change involves a shift from thinking about their sources (documents, books, images, audio, video etc) as objects, to viewing them as data. This creates a parallel shift from lone scholars engaging with individual objects one by one, to inter-disciplinary teams of researchers analyzing and making connections between data held in a variety of datasets. Not all humanities researchers will work like this, but we need to accept that programmatic access to our humanities datasets will become more and more important for humanities researchers in the coming decades. Upgrading our infrastructure to allow for this, and providing opportunities for researchers to develop the skills needed to undertake programmatic analysis of large datasets, is something we need to start now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Office of Digital Humanities in the US, along with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Joint Information Systems Committee and funding agencies in Canada and the Netherlands feel the same way, and established an annual &lsquo;Digging into Data&rsquo; event to help surface and resolve the issues involved in this shift. The Digging into Data challenge invites teams to choose a large dataset and engage in humanistic research on it, reporting back on their problems and successes. It&rsquo;s one important way the humanities community can assess what kind of impact this shift towards programmatic analysis is going to have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June of last year a report was published detailing preliminary findings based on early Digging into Data projects. Two findings that struck me relate to the data-centric nature of Humanities eResearch: aside from noting the massive opportunities opened up by eResearch, the report authors noted that</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The Digging into Data Challenge presents us with a new paradigm: a digital ecology of data, algorithms, metadata, analytical and visualization virtualmachines, and new forms of scholarly expression that result from this research.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>They also noted that</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>It is the combination of algorithmic analysis and human curation of data that helps humanists&hellip;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Humanities eResearch occupies a fuzzy place in in the broader eResearch landscape. It is both programmatic and subjective; it involves some researchers with solid programming skills and others who are more comfortable working with word clouds; and most importantly, the data is messy. It isn&rsquo;t only Google Books OCR that&rsquo;s the problem &ndash; most humanities datasets would make a scientist give up after a first look: nineteenth century ships logs, medical records from early twentieth century leper colonies, you name it, it&rsquo;ll be hard to read, incomplete and possibly inaccurate. We have traditional methods for dealing with issues like that, but the problems are multiplied exponentially when we port the sources into data formats. Curation, services and virtualmachines help a lot, but we also need time to identify and work through the issues, and develop appropriate training schemes for academic staff and their graduate students. So where are we at in New Zealand?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our biggest problem is awareness. New Zealand academic humanists have had little interest in either humanities computing or digital humanities, and because of this simply aren&rsquo;t aware what opportunities exist, or even what other countries are doing. Because of this our ability to contribute to a national conversation around eResearch infrastructure is low. I suspect most humanists have out-sourced these issues to scientists, social scientists and engineers without understanding just what a big impact decisions made outside their disciplines could have on them. We do have the component parts for an excellent Humanities eResearch infrastructure, though:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>DigitalNZ has been the envy of Australian colleagues for years now;</li>\r\n\t<li>The National Digital Heritage Archive is ahead of even the British influences in preservation of our digital heritage;</li>\r\n\t<li>We have a range of large-scale digital assets in the National influences&rsquo;s Timeframes archive, the Appendices to the Journals of the House of Representatives, and Papers Past.</li>\r\n\t<li>A significant government digital archive is about to come online.</li>\r\n\t<li>[It was noted, quite correctly, afterwards that we have a wide variety of other assets as well. The list above merely offers a snapshot of central government assets].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These could all be leveraged, and added to, to great effect if we can come up with a sensible strategy that connects these central government resources with humanities research communities. So, in short order, what we need is:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Education: Efforts are underway to get some regular digital humanities training from a Canadian team who are starting to provide global services, but we also need to increase our efforts to develop digital humanities at undergraduate and graduate level in order to offer the next generation of humanists the skills they need to engage with these issues.</li>\r\n\t<li>Capability building: We need to develop more digital projects, and provide guidance and feedback to humanists who would like to start their own. We also need to develop peer review mechanisms for student projects and PBRF (New Zealand&rsquo;s &lsquo;Performance Based Research Fund&rsquo;) so we can begin to understand what a &lsquo;quality&rsquo; humanities digital output actually looks like.</li>\r\n\t<li>International collaboration will help us develop more quickly. The international DH community is very welcoming, and many opportunities exist to collaborate.</li>\r\n\t<li>We need to start talking to humanities researchers about what they want from eResearch infrastructures. We could make some educated guesses, but as primary stakeholders they need to be consulted.</li>\r\n\t<li>We also need to work with NeSI [the National eScience Infrastructure team who organized eResearch 2013] and central government to turn any wish-list into strategically aligned and well defined requirements that can realistically be implemented.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Above all else, of course, we need funding. And this isn&rsquo;t funding only for the final infrastructure but for the education and capability building we need to do first. Compared to the final $ amounts required to implement a Humanities eResearch infrastructure this will be paltry, but it&rsquo;s important we make a start.</p>",

        "body": "<p>This post was republished as &lsquo;Evaluating Scholarly Digital Outputs: The 6 Layers Approach&rsquo;, <a href=\"http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-scholarly-digital-outputs-by-james-smithies/\">Journal of Digital Humanities</a>, 1:1, Fall, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The topic of appropriate standards for the evaluation of scholarly digital outputs has come up in conversation at my institution (the University of Canterbury, New Zealand) recently and I&rsquo;ve realised I haven&rsquo;t got a ready or simple answer, usually replying that such standards are extremely important because we need to ensure scholarly digital outputs attain to the same standards as, say, monographs, but that they&rsquo;re evolving. The conversations normally don&rsquo;t go much further than that. This post, then, is an attempt to get my thoughts down on paper so I can point colleagues to a handy url summarising my thoughts. Much of it will merely repeat common knowledge for digital humanists, but might be of interest.<br />\r\nFor a start, as someone employed as a Senior Lecturer in Digital Humanities, standards are of ineffable importance to me. While the &lsquo;big tent&rsquo; philosophy of the digital humanities (low barriers to entry and a supportive, welcoming community) is of central importance, it&rsquo;s becoming almost equally important that we are able to justify our existence within the academy to tenure and hiring committees, and of course funding agencies. For the digital humanities to have a future we need to be able to articulate what is &lsquo;good&rsquo; quality. Without that, even ignoring the potential effects on the scholarly reputation of the field, there is a danger that our students will go out into the job market claiming to have digital skills that aren&rsquo;t recognised as useful, or at the necessary level, by potential employers. In short, while we want to encourage all-comers, we also need to initiate people into an evolving set of standards that mark the difference between &lsquo;welcome contribution&rsquo; and &lsquo;scholarly output&rsquo;. While all content is welcome, and no-one is going to be able to produce high quality scholarly outputs in all the different varieties of the digital humanities, there is an expectation that work claiming to be &lsquo;scholarly grade&rsquo; needs to meet certain criteria.<br />\r\nI&rsquo;ve added some references below to get people started. The special edition of <em>Profession</em> is probably the best place to start. I too have an opinion, though. My feeling is that, in simple terms, there are 5 levels of standards met by most digital humanities projects, and a 6th that doesn&rsquo;t really make the grade at all. This isn&rsquo;t a hierarchical scale as much as a classification scheme describing types of projects seen &lsquo;in the wild&rsquo;. Not all digital humanities outputs are intended to be Category 1, for instance. Some, like this blog post, serve a quite different function. Other projects are produced by people just starting out with a new technology, so there is little chance the product will reach a standard required for tenure or review. They might be experienced digital humanists trying out a new method or experimenting with something likely to fail, or they might a beginner learning the ropes. In short, these are &lsquo;layers&rsquo; that all contribute in important ways to the digital humanities ecosystem. Each layer has a function, and is in many ways inter-dependent with the others. To denigrate any layer is to undermine our broader purpose. To paraphrase a friend of mine, &lsquo;they are what they are&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Category 1: The scholar has built the output themselves, or been a key driver in the technical design and build of it. The output has been driven and project managed by the scholar, often with external funding, including a high degree of technical input in both the design and build phases. The output is complex and/or wide-ranging (either in terms of project scope or technical complexity) and a highly innovative contribution to the field. It conforms to accepted standards in both the digital humanities and computer science. Significant and robust review milestones have been used during all phases of the project, including international feedback. Usage reports (where relevant or possible) indicate high engagement with the output from an international audience. The output has gained wide-spread recognition in both the scholarly and digital humanities communities, and perhaps broader media. It is sustainable, backed up, and controlled by good data management standards.</li>\r\n\t<li>Category 2: The scholar has built the output themselves, or been a key driver in the technical design and build of it (in this category, because the outputs tend to be of smaller scope than Cat.1, the expectation is really that the scholar has built it themselves, or been an integral part of the team that did) . It either conforms to accepted standards in both the digital humanities and computer science, or provides a conscious and challenging departure from them. The product is of limited scope, but represents an innovative contribution to the field and has gained significant recognition in either the scholarly community, digital humanities community, or the broader media. Usage reports (where relevant or possible) indicate high engagement with the output from an international audience.</li>\r\n\t<li>Category 3: The output has been built by an external service unit or vendor with no technical input from the scholar, but the scholar has been closely involved in the design and build phases, and contributed high quality content of some form (data or text, perhaps). The product conforms to some standards in either the digital humanities or computer science, but these are loosely applied and/or incompletely implemented.</li>\r\n\t<li>Category 4: The output has been built by an external service unit or vendor with no technical input from the scholar. It does not conform to generally accepted standards in either computer science or the digital humanities. The scholar, however, has provided high quality content of some form (data or text, perhaps) and the product is of use to general users and researchers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Category 5: This is a catch-all layer for all the wonderful stuff that the digital world enables &ndash; the ephemera of digital scholarship. Examples include blog posts, tweets, small contributions to code repositories etc. It&rsquo;s also the category that suggests a slightly relativistic attitude is needed when considering my categories, because Cat.5 outputs are incredibly important to the digital humanities. They are our flotsam and jetsam, the glue that keeps the community humming.</li>\r\n\t<li>Category 6: Rarely seen, and generally politely ignored if they are. This category doesn&rsquo;t conform to any standards, scholarly or otherwise, indicates little or no understanding of current discourses and practices in the digital humanities, and includes poor quality data or content.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This is only my very broad-brush take on the subject. The reason I present it here is that, like in any other field, the really important thing with digital humanities outputs is that the producer of them understands where their output fits within the broader intellectual context. While this won&rsquo;t always be the case &ndash; we always hope that something will come from left-field &ndash; it indicates both an understanding of the field, and respect for it. In general, though, I expect that builders of DH outputs have consciously designed and positioned their product within the broader landscape of DH, and understand that there is a broader matrix of standards and expectations alive in the community. Although I&rsquo;ve noticed that as the field grows only Cats. 1, 2 and 5 tend to get much airtime, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter which category the final product falls into&hellip;.unless it&rsquo;s Cat.6 and even then people don&rsquo;t tend to get too bothered: it is what it is. I should also note that I&rsquo;ve referred to &ldquo;the scholar&rdquo; in the singular above, but this is rarely the case in DH projects.

The paper is divided into three parts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<div style=\"text-align:left;\">&lsquo;Introduction to Digital Humanities, with apologies to Stanley Fish&rsquo;.</div>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<div style=\"text-align:left;\">Everyday Digital Humanities.</div>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<div style=\"text-align:left;\">Pedagogy and Deployment Models.</div>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;Introduction to Digital Humanities, with apologies to Stanley Fish</h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Towards the start of this year Stanley Fish sallied forth into the new terrain of Digital Humanities, in&nbsp;three blog posts in the <em>New York Times</em>.[1] His posts are a useful touchstone to begin with, not so much because they can be viewed as the coming of age of the Digital Humanities &ndash; their acceptance as a worthy subject in intellectual circles &ndash; but because they represent a disconnect between &lsquo;insider&rsquo; and &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; views of the practice. To humanists hitherto unaware that the digital humanities existed the posts may well have appeared as a shiny new contribution to knowledge penned by a self-styled &lsquo;defender of the faith&rsquo;, an up to the minute expose and timely overview of the latest set of barbarians to appear at our gates. Fish grabs the butterfly in mid-flight, throws a pin through its abdomen and proceeds to analyze it. The only problem is that the butterfly he caught and analyzed wasn&rsquo;t one that I expected; although I enjoyed Fish&rsquo;s attempt to heat up the debate, and felt he made some useful points, the &lsquo;digital humanities&rsquo; he was commenting on was different to the one I know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">How is this possible? I think there are three issues at play. Firstly, the digital humanities is just the latest name for a broad and varied intellectual culture that has been developing since the 1960s, when it first became apparent to humanists that computers might be of use. One look at the contents page to Blackwell&rsquo;s <em>Companion to Digital Humanities</em> indicates the sheer variety of activity that falls under the general umbrella: literary studies, archaeology, history, art history, classics, lexicography, music, multimedia, linguistics, performing arts&hellip;the list goes on. Each of these disciplines has a relationship to the digital humanities that goes back several decades, resulting in a far richer discourse than you would expect from a shiny new movement. While it&rsquo;s great that the development of the internet has made us more relevant, and a post-millennium boom has seen the number of centres and programmes blossom into over one hundred worldwide, the very success of the enterprise tends to privilege the new over the old. When people talk about the digital humanities they&rsquo;re often only talking about the tip of an iceberg &ndash; the part that appears on blogs and Twitter streams and points towards manifestos of intent. And while these aspects are of undeniable importance, it&rsquo;s unwise &ndash; as Fish did &ndash; to extrapolate from the part to the whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A second, related, issue is the conflation by Fish of the Digital Humanities with digital literary studies. This isn&rsquo;t entirely Fish&rsquo;s fault. The Digital Humanities, and Humanities Computing before that, have long found a welcome place in English departments, where the movement from analog &lsquo;text-on-paper&rsquo; to digital &lsquo;text-on-screen&rsquo; is of obvious interest. As is clearly demonstrated at our university, English departments are friends of the digital humanities. They incubate, they encourage, they provide institutional refuge and intellectual and theoretical fodder. But it would be a mistake to think that the digital humanities are a sub-discipline of English. Fish writes as if this was the case. He points his barbs at digital literary critics like Stephen Ramsay, who has produced a ground-breaking book arguing for &lsquo;algorithmic criticism&rsquo;, and Mathew Kirschenbaum whose reflection on &lsquo;digital forensics&rsquo; takes criticism to important new places, and &ndash;apparently stopping his investigations there &ndash; effectively generalizes their arguments to all digital humanists&hellip;unwittingly including digital historians, digital classicists, digital art historians and digital philosophers in his identification of writers he views as the advance guard in a new mode of obscurantism and lack-logic. In his defence, I have to point out that some digital literary critics invite this kind of category error by practicing it, but it does speak to a certain thinness in Fish&rsquo;s research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The third problem (and this is again related), is Fish&rsquo;s need to direct his reactionary crusade towards an identifiable enemy. In order to properly dampen the perceived threat of his inadequately defined digital humanities movement, Fish needs to bring it within the ambit of his known intellectual world of disciplines and departments, of academic tradition and campus politics. With the debate moved onto reassuringly familiar terrain through his conflation of DH with literary criticism, he is able to complete the movement towards intellectual hypostatization with such grand statements as:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">These two visions of the digital humanities project &mdash; the perfection of traditional criticism and the inauguration of something entirely new &mdash; correspond to the two attitudes digital humanists typically strike: (1) we&rsquo;re doing what you&rsquo;ve always been doing, only we have virtualmachines that will enable you to do it better; let us in, and (2) we are the heralds and bearers of a new truth and it is the disruptive challenge of that new truth that accounts for your recoiling from us. It is the double claim always made by an insurgent movement. We are a beleaguered minority and we are also the saving remnant.[2]</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I admit that Fish&rsquo;s outing of the predictable discourse of the-digital-humanities-as-insurgent-movement is useful: liminal groups often tend towards hyperbole and cast themselves as victims in order to undermine the power of the dominant group, and it isn&rsquo;t a good look. But, contrary to Fish&rsquo;s assertion that it&rsquo;s a central aspect of our discourse, in my experience DH culture tends to react against this kind of position. Or, I should say, the networked nature of the digital humanities community (based as it is on the distributed, social nature of the internet itself) reacts against it. This usually occurs by academic grandstanding being viewed, as Alan Liu&nbsp;might put it, as &lsquo;uncool&rsquo;[3], leading to it being ignored for a day or three until it is subsumed under the next stream of blog posts and Twitter updates. Nothing lasts long in cyberspace and digital humanities theory and method lives and dies in that space &ndash; the cycle of debate is blindingly fast by academic standards. There <em>are</em> some notable exceptions where a meme has developed what could be described as having &lsquo;enduring&rsquo; characteristics, where authors have stumbled upon a certain underlying zeitgeist (Fish seems to have stumbled upon many of these using his apparently Google-heavy research techniques), but there are always dissenting voices. I&rsquo;m one, for instance, who reacts quite heavily against the notion that print is in any way &ldquo;impoverished&rdquo; by comparison to digital media (a claim Fish suggests is characteristic of digital humanists as a whole); the notion is as absurd as that digital media is impoverished in some way to print. The fact is that they represent two different kinds of sources and need to be handled and interpreted according to their own requirements: what kind of source criticism are advocates of either of these positions teaching their students? That all books are trustworthy but anything digital isn&rsquo;t? or perhaps that text written on papyrus and leather can be read uncritically, but when digitized those same texts become radically untrustworthy? Of course not: text criticism is a process rather than a simple if/else procedure. Researchers need a broad critical toolkit, and the ability to use the correct tool when confronted with particular artifacts. No format, be it analog or digital, should get a free pass when it comes to scholarly analysis. One important aspect of digital humanities pedagogy for me, then, is format agnosticism &ndash; the belief that the format of the source is less important than the scholarly virtualmachines we apply to gain an understanding of it. With digital sources we need to be comfortable enough and knowledgeable enough with the underlying technologies to understand the potential benefits and pitfalls of working with them: if twentieth century scholars saw only a rupture between analog and digital sources, twenty-first century scholars need to see a continuum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so back to Fish. I don&rsquo;t want to come across as bagging him here, because his posts were of immeasurable use to the digital humanities community; it&rsquo;s good to see us being taken seriously by a well-known thinker. It&rsquo;s just that the weaknesses in his analysis present the perfect introduction to the digital humanities. He makes a variety of mistakes that a newcomer to the field can be excused for making, partly because Google privileges a shallow history oriented towards social media and blog posts that gain the greatest number of raw hits rather than being ones that our small community necessarily values, partly because people practicing digital humanities are prone to category errors themselves, and partly because the field is deceptively broad and complex. Apparently unbeknownst to Fish his posts, as it happens, were published at the same time as a rather robust debate on the role of Theory in the digital humanities (along with attendant anxieties about identity and purpose) was playing out across the community. He wrote in apparent ignorance of this, which is a shame because I&rsquo;m sure he would have made good use of it: his analysis of the digital humanities proper, as opposed to the digital literary critics he happened upon in his Google searches, would be interesting indeed. I can only provide a rather droll synopsis (along with a couple of points added by me&nbsp;on a whim)&nbsp;of what was a quite significant debate here:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The field is developing too fast to allow for a stable definition to appear, and we&rsquo;re not sure what value such a definition would serve anyway. The practice will eventually be defined by research outputs, syllabi and digital products, but those must surely precede definition.</li>\r\n\t<li>Some of us want to keep the barriers to entry low for some time yet: who are we to define what is and what isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;DH&rsquo;?</li>\r\n\t<li>Few digital humanists are interested in politicising the practice.</li>\r\n\t<li>Some digital humanists are interested in theorising the practice.</li>\r\n\t<li>Some digital humanists resist theorising the practice, feeling that method and code are more important (or even that &lsquo;DH arguments are encoded in code&rsquo; [4], rendering further theorising redundant).</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a general consensus that, at base, digital humanities is simply about &lsquo;building stuff&rsquo;.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is some debate on the matter, but many digital humanists would assert that the ability to code (or at least a willingness to learn) is of fundamental importance.</li>\r\n\t<li>If there was a single slogan, it would be &lsquo;Do It Yourself&rsquo; rather than getting someone else to do it for you.</li>\r\n\t<li>If there was a single value it would be &lsquo;Open Access and Open Source&rsquo;, but only in a way that enhances rather than endangers current academic business models.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a genuine feeling in the digital humanities that we can help the tradition and are a part of it, not a radical new departure from it.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a difference between a humanist who dabbles with digital virtualmachines, and a Digital Humanist who wants to learn how the digital world works from the level of code to broader system architectures, in an effort to gain the level of understanding required to build high quality research virtualmachines and produce informed criticism of digital culture.</li>\r\n\t<li>We aren&rsquo;t entirely focused on the academic world. Many digital humanities programmes work closely with libraries and other cultural heritage organisations, and all are focused on engaging with the community through public and applied humanities.</li>\r\n\t<li>Our goal of opening up scholarship to the wider world (bypassing gated academic services and delivering content on the open internet) is reflective of this. Many digital humanists work outside the academy, and they can&rsquo;t read our work and engage in our community if we lock our articles into services like&nbsp;JSTOR.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go much further than this, though. Although by no means as deep or broad, the terrain follows basically the same undulations and cul-de-sacs as the Humanities as a whole: no single assumption holds, no generalization works. And this, I suspect, is the reason that digital humanists tend to resist definition &ndash; there just isn&rsquo;t much point, and when it all boils down, we&rsquo;d prefer to get on and build stuff. It might even be like trying to define the Humanities themselves&hellip;fine for a Wikipedia entry, but inevitably inadequate. And so to Wikipedia, for a decent-enough definition of what I do (and no, I&rsquo;m not going to condescend to tell you the correct interpretative weight to place on a Wikipedia entry):</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The digital humanities is an area of research, teaching, and creation concerned with the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. Sometimes called humanities computing, the field has focused on the digitization and analysis of materials related to the traditional disciplines of the humanities. Digital Humanities currently incorporates both digitized and born-digital materials and combines the methodologies from the traditional humanities disciplines (such as history, philosophy, linguistics, literature, art, archaeology, music, and cultural studies) with virtualmachines provided by computing (such as data visualisation, information retrieval, data mining computational analysis) and digital publishing.[5]</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">As an introduction what I&rsquo;ve presented thus far might seem rather opaque, but that&rsquo;s intentional. Our field is one with no front door, no manual and no codex, and although every year seems to take us closer to having those things, there&rsquo;s no passionate ground-swell suggesting that it must happen. If we melt back into the Tradition so be it; if we end up with highly structured departments, so be it. If there is a radical edge to the digital humanities it&rsquo;s in this casual attitude towards the expectations of the traditional academic community: an assertion that we&rsquo;re doing OK and are happy to muddle along, develop our community, and see where things go. And Fish is right &ndash; there is an element of the insurgent attitude in this, but it&rsquo;s more postmodern cynicism than politicized modernist angst. Let&rsquo;s face it: the twentieth century humanism that demanded structure and definition, and the likes of Fish are so comfortable with, may allow for rigorous debate, but it hasn&rsquo;t left us in such a good state. The Internet, however, with its distributed and (at least for the moment) radically open structures of knowledge, seems to offer some hope:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">In as much as digital humanities is an Internet-based social network, it should come as no surprise that digital humanities looks a lot like the Internet itself. Digital humanities takes more than virtualmachines from the Internet. It works like the Internet. It takes its values from the Internet.[6]</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">If there is radicalism afoot this is where it lies. In my more imaginative moments I wonder if this aspect of the digital humanities represents a return to a kind of ideal Greek marketplace of ideas, where the Academy is situated not in an ivory tower but at the center of public space &ndash; subject to its whims as well as its energy. But those moments always dissolve in the realization that for better or worse we&rsquo;re being encouraged into the ivory towers, and this implies that any idealism will inevitably be blunted by exposure to the administrative and cultural constraints imposed by the university system. In the last few years it&rsquo;s become clear, for instance, that the startup consensus many of us have enjoyed since around 2000 is coming to a close &ndash; evidenced most clearly by Matt Gold&rsquo;s recent anthology titled &lsquo;Debates in the Digital Humanities&rsquo;. On the whole the discipline (if you want to call it that) is still formative enough to be able to proscribe the seamier kinds of academic in-fighting, but it is also too developed to allow for the kind of na&iuml;ve consensus that Fish implies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Everyday Practices</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Given all this, and the need to have you leave this seminar with at least an inkling of what the digital humanities are all about, I&rsquo;d like to offer a snapshot into everyday practices. It isn&rsquo;t how we define ourselves as a group that&rsquo;s important, after all, it&rsquo;s what we do &ndash; whether we&rsquo;re recognisable as humanists when you&rsquo;re given a glimpse into our day, whether we&rsquo;re doing stuff that interests you. So what follows is just that &ndash; a snapshot of activities I&rsquo;ve found myself doing in the 7 months since I began work as New Zealand&rsquo;s first Senior Lecturer in Digital Humanities, augmented by a couple of things I know I&rsquo;ll be doing soon enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Twitter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of digital humanists are augmenting their use of Twitter with Google+, because it allows for longer posts and thus more in-depth conversations, but Twitter is still the primary means of communication across the digital humanities community. Our community is global and networked. If you want to get a handle on topics de jour you try to catch a minute to read your feed. If you have something to contribute you post yourself. If you want to contribute to the international digital humanities community &ndash; and contribution is key &ndash; get an account and get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Read, and perhaps peer review, Digital Humanities Now</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DH Now </a>is the goto publication for information on the digital humanities. Its base content is sourced from scholarly work referenced in Twitter feeds and blogs, which is then curated by an editorial team and opened up to the community for open peer review. The editorial team currently sifts through 15,000 &lsquo;submissions&rsquo; per quarter. Built by the Centre for History and New Media at George Mason University in the US, it&rsquo;s a significant attempt to modernise the academic peer review process for the digital age, and a classic example of the kind of problems digital humanists want to solve. The platform itself is available for anyone to use, and a <a href=\"http://gpdh.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital History version </a>of it appeared a couple of weeks ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Check out new work by a digital humanist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, Tim Sherrat&rsquo;s website &lsquo;<a href=\"http://www.invisibleaustralians.org/faces/\" target=\"_blank\">The Real Face of White Australia</a>&rsquo;, which uses facial detection scripts to present identity cards of Asian immigrants to Australia that were buried somewhere in the depths of the National Archives of Australia. The code is open source and available for reuse on Github, so anyone can use it to find out how it was done, and create similar websites. The project is part of a broader project Tim is working on with historian Kate Bagnall. We&rsquo;re developing a strong trans-Tasman digital humanities community, through the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities. Tim attended last year&rsquo;s National Digital Forum in Wellington, and will be at Sydney Shep&rsquo;s inaugural Digital History Workshop at Vic at the end of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Design and manage a digital archive</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Millar and I are working on a project to archive digital content related to the Canterbury earthquakes, called <a href=\"http://www.ceismic.org.nz\" target=\"_blank\">UC CEISMIC</a>. It needs to be characterised as an &lsquo;advanced digital humanities&rsquo; project, in that it is too big for even a doctoral project. That being said, we don&rsquo;t have the standards in place to assess it properly even if someone did present us with a similar idea for a doctorate (it would need to be accompanied by an analytical thesis), and it&rsquo;s uncertain whether it will contribute in any tangible way to my or Paul&rsquo;s PBRF portfolios for the same reason. I need to start producing some research outputs about the project this year to ensure this happens one way or another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Supervise an Honours thesis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year I helped Paul supervise Donelle McKinley&rsquo;s excellent Honours thesis on crowd-sourcing techniques used at the New York Public influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Supervise&nbsp;Summer of eResearch engineering students</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked with Sydney Shep from Victoria over the summer, supervising two computer science students on a project to build a plugin for the Omeka digital archive system. The plugin allows anyone to easily harvest content from DigitalNZ and create their own online galleries, and is available from our university digital humanities site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Produce research articles, book proposals, blog posts, seminars and conference papers on digital humanities and New Zealand literary history</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to admit that I got more of this kind of work done when I was working outside university, but as UC CEISMIC becomes operational I&rsquo;m hoping to have time to devote to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>System Administration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One result of the digital humanities&rsquo; emphasis on DIY is that we find ourselves&hellip;doing a lot of things ourselves. This increases our workload, and mature centres tend to hire technical administrators to take over the work, but for now our understanding with ICTS is that since we have the skills and don&rsquo;t like waiting in queues, they&rsquo;ll manage the operating system layer and we&rsquo;ll look after the application layer of our web servers. It&rsquo;s cyclical work that doesn&rsquo;t come around very often, but has to be done to ensure things keep running.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Pedagogy and Deployment Models</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of you might be wondering where teaching comes into this, given it&rsquo;s one of our primary reasons for existence. In normal circumstances you could assume my work on the UC CEISMIC archive would be swapped out for teaching, but we&rsquo;re still in the process of developing the digital humanities programme, guiding it through the Committee on University Academic Programmes (CUAP) process. I&rsquo;ll spare you the details of our proposed programme, beyond the two draft course outlines in the <a href=\"http://jamessmithies.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ucdhdraftoutlines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">handout</a>, which will look very much like any other postgraduate humanities programme (we haven&rsquo;t got immediate plans for undergraduate offerings) and be circulated across the College, university and some international colleagues. Students will be taught theory and method, along with basic programming and project management skills, all in the context of traditional humanities topics in history, culture and literature. The aim is to produce graduates who have solid critical skills, are aware of the main currents in humanities as well as digital humanities scholarship, and are capable of using basic digital virtualmachines and methods in their research and writing. There&rsquo;ll be options for practical courses as well, which will provide internship and work experience opportunities. That doesn&rsquo;t explain much about how digital humanities is going to be developed at UC, though. It gives you a broad sketch of what kind of pedagogical flavor the programme will have, but not how it will fit into the structure of the School of Humanities and College of Arts and, as with defining digital humanities, this isn&rsquo;t something I have a simple answer to (and is a point of debate across the digital humanities as a whole). I&rsquo;m suggesting we take a careful approach that blends a couple of possibilities and keeps open opportunities to change things as required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked where the digital humanities programme will fit at Canterbury, I generally point to two common &lsquo;deployment models&rsquo; and explain that we&rsquo;re taking a third, blended approach. The first model is a &lsquo;distributed&rsquo; one:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-test.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2015/04/09/distributed.png\" style=\"height:259px; width:630px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Academics from a broad range of disciplines, all with an interest in digital humanities who are active in the community, begin incorporating digital aspects into their teaching and research. Over time, their work reaches a level of sophistication that demands greater organisation, and a Centre evolves, providing a hub of activity and a repository for the collective expertise of the group. Such a centre might be interdisciplinary, or it might be located in one department, but it will be an adjunct to the main academic departmental structure. This was how I started in digital humanities when I was working in the History department some years back &ndash; just a young graduate tinkering with a few ideas, connecting with an overseas community and considering ways I could set a Centre up. The benefit of such an approach is that things develop organically, and expand only as expertise and understanding develop &ndash; there&rsquo;s no risk of over-extension and digital humanities remain distributed across the School as a whole. The scholars associated with the Centre keep teaching in their core discipline, but (if the Centre is a success) find themselves spending more and more time working with other digital humanists. The downside of such an approach is that there is so much dispersal that it can be difficult to gain traction, and (significantly) because Centres are outside the main university funding channels they&rsquo;re constantly under threat. In my case my contract expired and I left academia before I could achieve much more than building a couple of websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The alternative model, which we probably look like we&rsquo;re following, is a &lsquo;centralised&rsquo; one:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-test.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2015/04/09/centralised.png\" style=\"height:239px; width:509px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this approach, an effort is made to establish a Digital Humanities Department or Programme along traditional lines, seeding it with a permanent academic or academics who can drive development and truly give it their best shot. The risk is that students won&rsquo;t be interested or external funding won&rsquo;t be forthcoming, and you&rsquo;ll be lumped with an under-utilised staff member, but it has the great benefit of making sense to the broader university and its administrators. It&rsquo;s uncommon, but sensible. In fact, Digital Humanities at Kings College have recently transitioned from being a Centre to a Department for exactly this reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My preference, though, and the one I&rsquo;m recommending for Canterbury, is a mixed model that draws on the common theme in the IT industry of &lsquo;incubation&rsquo;:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-test.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2015/04/09/mixed.png\" style=\"height:282px; width:630px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The idea is that we set digital humanities up at Canterbury within the Department of English, Cinema and Digital Humanities in an ostensibly centralised model, but only at postgraduate level. At undergraduate level we&rsquo;ll encourage interested colleagues to build digital components into their courses, and help them out as best we can if they&rsquo;d like advice. If people would rather do things on their own &ndash; learn to use digital virtualmachines and methods on their own &ndash; that&rsquo;s cool (it&rsquo;s how I did it, after all). After three years we&rsquo;ll assess how things are going, and either set up a Centre (with significant external funding), branch out as an independent department, continue as we are alongside English and Cinema Studies or (an option that perhaps wouldn&rsquo;t work so well for my career prospects) dissolve back into other departments and continue under a distributed model. Either way, the hope is that, after three years, the School of Humanities and the College of Arts will have had a significant increase in activity in things digital, it will be apparent whether we&rsquo;re going to be an asset or liability for English and Cinema Studies, some pathways into digital humanities study at postgraduate level will have been created, and it will generally be clearer what we should do next.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><strong>2013</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<div>&bull; Introduction to Digital Humanities</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&bull; The Digital Modern: Humanities and New Media</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&bull; Digital Literary Studies</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&bull; Digital Humanities Research Essay</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&bull; Applied Digital Humanities</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&bull; Digital Humanities Directed Reading and Writing</div>\r\n\r\n<h5><strong>2014 &ndash; 2015</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<div>&bull; Postgraduate Diploma, Masters and Doctoral courses.</div>\r\n\r\n<h5><strong>2015 &ndash;</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<div>&bull; Undergraduate?</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>__________________________________________________</div>\r\n\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align:left\">References</h4>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">[1] Stanley Fish. &ldquo;Mind Your P&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s: The Digital Humanities and Interpretation.&rdquo; <em>Opinionator</em>, January 23, 2012. <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/mind-your-ps-and-bs-the-digital-humanities-and-interpretation/\" target=\"_blank\">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/mind-your-ps-and-bs-the-digital-humanities-and-interpretation/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. &ldquo;The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality.&rdquo; <em>Opinionator</em>, January 01, 2012. <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/\" target=\"_blank\">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. &ldquo;The Old Order Changeth.&rdquo; <em>Opinionator,</em> December 26<sup>th</sup>, 2011. <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/the-old-order-changeth/\" target=\"_blank\">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/the-old-order-changeth/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">[2] Fish. &ldquo;Mind Your P&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">[3] Liu, Alan. <em>The Laws of Cool: Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information</em>.

        "excerpt": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching the current Theory Debate via <a href=\"http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Humanities Now</a> this past week or so with interest but have only just found the time to write down my reaction to it.

        "body": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching the current Theory Debate via <a href=\"http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Humanities Now</a> this past week or so with interest but have only just found the time to write down my reaction to it. It&rsquo;s a topic that has been dear to my heart for some time now. It touches on the question of where the digital humanities stand in relation to the core tradition, and what direction it&rsquo;s going to take as a practice (I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m keen for it to become a &lsquo;discipline&rsquo; in the traditional sense of the term). I&rsquo;ve often said that if DH is to be taken seriously by the analog humanities it will need to begin to engage with some core humanities practices, develop some kind of theoretical framework(s), identify some core methodologies, and&nbsp; generally produce some writing that has recognizable intellectual &lsquo;grunt&rsquo;. We&rsquo;re developing a new community of practice within a 2000+ year tradition that includes some rather weighty names, after all. We should attain to the development of a sub-tradition that draws on everything at our disposal. And that implies &lsquo;a whole bunch of stuff&rsquo;. A few years ago, while I was working in London, I actually started a website called <em>d-hist</em>, that aimed to united digital history with the core methodological and theoretical traditions taught in post-graduate History classes. I wanted to write a series of essays along the lines of &lsquo;The Historical Dialectic and Digital History&rsquo; &ndash; the idea was just to get in the kitchen and start throwing ideas together. Unfortunately I was working in IT rather than academe and it went nowhere. My point here is that I&rsquo;m by no means against Theory, which is crucial to the long-term viability of digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of my professors used to say, though, &lsquo;Theory is like wine. It&rsquo;s best enjoyed when it&rsquo;s of high quality, and even then only in moderation&rsquo;. The problem with humanistic theorizing, of course, is that it can have a stultifying effect. I love it, but it&rsquo;s also a good part of the reason why the humanities are in such a dire position in today&rsquo;s intellectual world. I won&rsquo;t open that can of worms any further, except to note that my understanding is that &lsquo;DH Culture&rsquo; (such as it is) has been resistant to theory partly for this reason. Many early DHers fled to the practice precisely to avoid overly-theorized colleagues arguing in ever-decreasing circles. We enjoyed being incubated from the culture wars of the eighties and nineties, and it&rsquo;s possible to argue that if this hadn&rsquo;t been a guiding assumption in those post-Netscape years we wouldn&rsquo;t be in as good a position as we are today. The argument would go that DH is fresh, new, and untainted from the (I think necessary, if also painful and destructive) battles of the 1980s and 1990s. If we provide hope to embattled colleagues and can be described as a healthy and rare green shoot for the humanities now, it is at least in part because we&rsquo;re free of the theoretical baggage that is sinking (or has sunk) other humanities disciplines. We need to tread carefully, and although we should encourage digital humanists to emphasize humanities content over computer science, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean we should subvert our vital connection with computer science by theorizing for the sake of theorizing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To perhaps grossly over-simplify things, the current conversation seems to me to hinge around two poles that can be broadly characterized as &lsquo;Theory versus Code&rsquo;, on the one hand we have an understandable desire to make our practice more recognizably humanistic by wrapping it in the kind of critical analysis that is grist to our mill (which requires Theory as the bedstone), on the other we have a commitment to code because our facility with this is the thing that marks DH as a fundamental and exciting departure from the main tradition. <a href=\"http://nataliacecire.blogspot.com/2011/10/when-dh-was-in-vogue-or-thatcamp-theory.html\" target=\"_blank\">Natalia Cecire</a> has represented the former position very well over the past couple of weeks, and it is one that deserves respect. The other side of the equation is perhaps best represented by Tom Scheinfeldt&rsquo;s comment that &lsquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/foundhistory/status/134808062283354112\" target=\"_blank\">DH arguments are encoded in code</a>&lsquo; and don&rsquo;t need elaboration. As the paragraph above might suggest, I&rsquo;ve got a lot of time for this position. DHers who believe we should focus on virtualmachines and code take a pragmatic stance that doesn&rsquo;t proscribe Theory, but implies that &lsquo;the code is the theory&rsquo;, or at least &lsquo;the code is all we need&rsquo;. The implication is that the empowering feature of DH is that it puts the means of production into the hands of humanists by developing skill at a code level. Such a position implies that DH is primarily about making and hacking: I suspect there&rsquo;s a deep-seated concern across the community that if we lose that focus in an attempt to theorize the domain we risk sliding back into the insufferable cultural, professional and intellectual situation that code allowed us to escape. I&rsquo;m by no means suggesting that every person at the Code end of the spectrum thinks this is the case (there&rsquo;s nothing in their writing that suggests hostility), but I certainly agree with those who feel the development of Theory is risky for DH. To state things baldly, it threatens a return to everything we stand against: partisan politics, ideological wars, normative rather than inclusive politics. The worst case scenario is that it acts as a Trojan horse, importing all that is wrong with the humanities into all that is good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My &lsquo;worst case scenario&rsquo; could also be described as &lsquo;paranoid anti-theoretical nonsense&rsquo;, of course. As I suggested at the start of this post, the application of high quality theory and method to the digital humanities is essential if we are to develop as an intellectual community and be taken seriously by our peers. The significant point here for me, is that the way to do this is to scale out our focus on virtualmachines and code towards a broader, dare I say it more holistic view, that encompasses governance and infrastructure alongside theory and method, content and philosophy. This is the position I put forward in my piece (currently still in preview) in <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em>. In <a href=\"http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000107/000107.html\" target=\"_blank\">that article</a> I argue that if we&rsquo;re going to create a robust theoretical and methodological apparatus for DH we&rsquo;re going to need to look to some IT approaches like enterprise architecture, and adapt them to our purposes. While I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t describe myself as having anything more than rudimentary coding skills, therefore, I have no doubt that code should remain at the center of our community and our practice: it is the lodestone to which&nbsp; we&rsquo;ll need to return to again and again to keep ourselves on track. This doesn&rsquo;t imply we all need to become computer scientists, though. <a href=\"http://www.hackingthehumanities.org/post/theory-dh-and-noticing\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Murray-John&rsquo;s</a> suggestion that DHers should at least be able to intelligently discuss a data model, or (to clumsily paraphrase) understand why developers can&rsquo;t turn lead into gold, strikes me as a sensible approach to take. We need to understand code enough to use it and hack at it for basic purposes. Some will go further and become experts in a particular language, thereby empowering the community as a whole with deep channels of knowledge, but we&rsquo;re too open for this to become the sine qua non of acceptance. We need basic coding skills so we can do some things ourselves and can move beyond the veil of new media surfaces to understand how digital products function &lsquo;behind the curtain&rsquo; &ndash; this much is essential for both practical and critical reasons. We also need to understand the technical and creative constraints code places on designers and developers, and be capable of contributing intelligently and usefully to a software development team, but beyond that I suspect anything goes. As an aside, and not that any DHers have suggested it yet, it&rsquo;s important to remember that if the IT industry demanded coding proficiency for entrance to the profession developers would have to do their thing without the support of a plethora of project managers, business analysts, technical writers and testers (not to mention managers). These people don&rsquo;t necessarily code, but they sure understand IT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think we need to go even further, though, and avoid the simplistic Code versus Theory bind I outlined (and perhaps erroneously identified, too) above. While code should remain our lodestone, Murray-John&rsquo;s comment brought home to me that our value to the humanities is broader than this. It lies in the fact that we understand how software and web applications work at not only the code level but also at the systems and infrastructure level.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think we should leave the digital humanities to <em>either</em> a reliance on //code comments, <em>or</em> to purely humanistic traditions derived from literary or historical practice. We need something more radical and broad-ranging than that: we need theoretical and methodological frameworks (note the plural) that can describe the intellectual, cultural and (this is of vital importance) <em>systemic</em> nature of our craft. Humanistic theories and methods imported from literary and historical analysis will of course be central to this, but those approaches will not stop code breaking, or ensure that future humanistic infrastructures are well integrated and sustainable. Theory, then, will occupy a central position in the digital humanities, and we need more of it rather than less, but we also need to remind ourselves that unlike other disciplines we&rsquo;re building systems: systems of code, systems of metadata&hellip;&hellip;the list goes on. Unlike other humanities disciplines, our theory needs to be what I will clumsily term &lsquo;systemically functional&#39;: it needs to support not only our cultural and intellectual needs, but our technical needs. This is no small task, in fact I suspect it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;big hairy goal&rsquo; that will remain aspirational for a long time in lieu of anyone getting a grasp on what&rsquo;s really required, but it strikes me that it&rsquo;s a task worthy of our attention. Right now, it&rsquo;s probably time for a glass of wine.</p>\r\n",

It articulates a moral imperative that has long been a driving force of the digital humanities but is infrequently surfaced, perhaps for good reason given the dangers of mixing intellectual and cultural movements with claims that they coincide with the morally correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>2.3.2 Second, digitisation is more than a technical option, it is a moral obligation. In a time when more and more cultural goods are consumed online, when screens and digital devices are becoming ubiquitous, it is crucial to bring culture online (and, in fact, a large part of it is already there). If we don&rsquo;t pursue this task, we run the risk of progressively eroding and losing what has been the foundation of European countries and civilization in the last centuries. It must be clearly understood that if access is the final objective, a tall order, it can only be achieved through preservation of the work.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The report has reminded me why I started working in the digital humanities: at some level, even when debates about Wikipedia were making their way across universities and it appeared that reactionary influences would drown the discipline (such as it was) in a sea of cynicism, it was clear that the movement of the humanities into an online environment had implications that couldn&rsquo;t be ignored. For me, the imperative for involvement was connected to a desire to preserve an intellectual and cultural heritage I felt was threatened, not by the movement towards the digital but by a reaction in the scholarly community against it. A decade or so later the Comit&eacute; des Sages is articulating the same concern, but with a much greater degree of maturity. They point out that the task facing our generation of scholars, librarians and cultural heritage organizations has moral implications that will impact future generations. If we get the balance wrong, for instance between the need to involve commercial interests and the need to offer cultural material freely, we risk not only a massive amount of funding but an opportunity to do an enormous amount of good. I&rsquo;m not so naive as to posit a direct connection between this kind of governmental politico-speak and the objectives of your &lsquo;average&rsquo; (whatever that is) digital humanist, but I am bold enough to suggest that whether we&rsquo;re comfortable with it or not, a moral imperative provides a backdrop to much of our code.</p>\r\n",

        "body": "<p>Tom Scheinfeldt&rsquo;s recent blog entry &lsquo;What Digital Humanists Like&rsquo; suggests the discipline is structured in a similar way to social networks, with the main conversation based on Twitter and an organizational structure best conceived as a series of horizontally (as opposed to vertically or hierarchically) organized nodes. My feeling is that the digital humanities also need to be conceptualized from the point of view of engineering and the history of technology, but that&rsquo;s another issue. Perhaps it&rsquo;s enough to note here that although a &lsquo;nodal&rsquo; interpretation of the digital humanities presents a healthy view of the humanist imperatives we all hold, it does little to &lsquo;out&rsquo; our entanglement with the technology and philosophies of modernity. To this end, to foreground the social at the expense of the engineered is a (perhaps wilful?) denial of an uncomfortable reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My point here isn&rsquo;t to criticize Tom&rsquo;s great post, though, but to build on it. Most readers will know that I&rsquo;m rather weary when it comes to the digital humanities in New Zealand: after almost a decade of interest in the field, watching CHNM go from strength to strength and scores of centers crop up around the world I&rsquo;ve seen frustratingly little progress in New Zealand universities (although there&rsquo;s been a nice wee flurry of activity recently). I hope I don&rsquo;t need to reiterate that this is not entirely a reflection on staff who have undergone years of restructuring and are justifiably focused on teaching and traditional research, in the face of administrations that seem extremely backward. The story is typical enough: selling a mantra of innovation but only resourcing it to the level of marketing material. Our government doesn&rsquo;t help by foregrounding academic funding opportunities that aim to bring our science and technology sectors into the 21st century, at the same time as they leave humanists in the 20th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what of the optimistic view? Bethany Nowviskie&rsquo;s recent visit to Wellington, which I unfortunately missed due to work commitments, reminded me that there is still time for growth. Aside from enjoying her tweets about Wellington (you got lucky with the weather, Bethany), it made me wonder whether the digital humanities haven&rsquo;t developed in New Zealand universities because we haven&rsquo;t got the terms of reference right. Maybe I&rsquo;ve been trying to sell my colleagues, and by implication the universities generally, the wrong brand of Koolaid? For the past decade or so I&rsquo;ve unthinkingly pressed for a very &lsquo;northern hemisphere&rsquo; (I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the right term to use, but it will suffice as shorthand) brand of digital humanities, as if the digital humanities are destined to be a normative intellectual movement with little variation across geographic locations. This may have been the case in the early days, but as Tom&rsquo;s nodal network develops we should expect it to become less and less the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If so, there are some exciting opportunities for digital humanists based in New Zealand. My feeling is that these opportunities lie in part (the approach is only one part of a complex milieu, and has suffered from a degree of modish assimilation from writers of funding applications over the years) with the nurturing of intellectual and cultural approaches specific to Oceania and the Pacific Rim, and the &lsquo;exportation&rsquo; of those ideas to other more established nodes in the network. It would undoubtedly be a welcome contribution. Just as the Pacific has offered the northern hemisphere an &lsquo;alternative modernity&rsquo; since the eighteenth century, so it might offer an alternative node to the digital humanities community &ndash; and that node, properly conceived, may well present our friends in the north with some useful new perspectives. To borrow the words of Australian sociologist Peter Beilharz, and to return to my interest in the digital humanities as a tool of modernity, our Pacific node could even turn out to be the enabler of &lsquo;[a]nother Civilization, Between Manhattan and the Rhine&rsquo;. If this is the case, we might decide to build a digital &lsquo;sea of islands&rsquo; (Epeli Hau&rsquo;ofa) reflective of Pacific intellectuals&rsquo; penchant for heterogeneity and cultural pastiche &ndash; a series of digital beaches connected by high-speed internet connections. There&rsquo;s an element of post-colonialism in this conception of a Pacific-centered digital humanities node, of course. As much as the international digital humanities community are gregariously interested in new ideas and encouraging of equal participation on all levels and by all groups, they cannot conceive of our local needs, because we haven&rsquo;t articulated them yet. We need to formulate those needs and then engage with colleagues outside the Pacific to bring a new, digital, vision to reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>References</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.

This has huge implications for the integrity of future scholarship, but opens up equally fascinating areas for research and analysis.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m working with a team of systems analysts at the moment and it has got me thinking about what kind of &lsquo;business intelligence&rsquo; digital humanists have at our disposal. The humanities have developed organically, in a kind of &lsquo;conversational&rsquo; or maybe dialectical process that remains opaque and resistant to formal analysis, but I&rsquo;m wondering if the convergence of our disciplines with technology necessitates more than this. I accept that I&rsquo;m flirting with nonsense here: technology is just a delivery mechanism and needn&rsquo;t determine future directions in the humanities, so why waste time analysing it? We should just use it to deliver our products. It&rsquo;s a fair attitude to adopt if you&rsquo;re more focussed on what I&rsquo;ll call &lsquo;traditional products&rsquo; (books, journal articles etc), but I think it&rsquo;s a bit short-sighted for those us interested in pressing the digital humanities towards what they might worthily be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what am I suggesting? The idea would be to undertake a formal systems analysis of the engineered sub-structure to our new field, combined with an analysis of the &lsquo;interface&rsquo; between traditional humanist outputs and this sub-structure, potential new directions made possible by that sub-structure, and problems imposed by that sub-structure. It would perhaps need to be done at a disciplinary level initially, with those findings combined into a meta-analysis of the entire field when we&rsquo;d gathered enough information. I am sure, for instance, that an analysis undertaken by an English professor would be quite different to one undertaken by a historian. Sounds like an idea that&rsquo;s far too heavy to get off the ground, eh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ignoring the leaden quality of the idea, though, what do I mean by &rsquo;sub-structure&rsquo;? Commercial systems analysts would probably suggest it&rsquo;s a woolly idea (as it may well be), but the idea would be to offer digital humanists a basic overview of the underlying &lsquo;wiring&rsquo; of the internet, including domain name servers, routers, key data centres and &rsquo;suchlike&rsquo;. The next layer of analysis would perhaps be to describe the governing bodies like ICANN&nbsp;which control (for want of a better word) the flow of information across the internet, and point out their interactions with international&nbsp;law, national governments and, by extension, humanists sitting in their offices producing their digital outputs. Wikipedia&nbsp;offers a decent overview and there will be very good descriptions offered in various other places, but I&rsquo;m suggesting that humanists need to do it themselves as well, and that a collaborative approach would suit such a project quite well. We all know how descriptive analysis tends to track the interests of the inquirer, and I have a feeling humanists could offer some interesting perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of my interest in this topic stems from a 1960 article by Ernest Nagel in&nbsp;<em>Philosophy and Phenomelogical Research</em>&nbsp;titled &lsquo;Determinism in History&rsquo;, where he brilliantly explores the parallels between tightly defined scientific articulations of a &rsquo;system&rsquo;, and the way that historians conceive historical &rsquo;systems&rsquo;. The article was written in the heat of the history-as-system debates prompted by Marxist class analyses, which claimed that History was a closed and definable system determined by economic forces. As is well known, the idea that history was determined in this way sparked furious debate and eventually led to an unspoken (if not uniformly accepted) consensus that this couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the case: it revolted human sensibilities to suggest that our destiny was in the hands of impersonal systemic forces. Nagel&rsquo;s analysis was brilliant because, although arguing&nbsp;<em>against</em>&nbsp;naive determinism in historical interpretations, he was brave enough to dive right in and argue that, properly conceived, History is indeed systemically determined (just like a chemical reaction, no less)&nbsp;but in an indeterminate way.&nbsp;Building on the very small / very large anomalies observed in the quantum world, Nagel noted that although basically deterministic, historical systems were simply too large (or small in some cases) and complex to identify the deterministic forces at work. The article isn&rsquo;t particularly well known, but it still stuns me to think that at a time when most mainstream historical theorists were doggedly refusing to acknowledge that History was determined to any degree at all, lest Marxists leverage the gap, Nagel was capable of offering a sophisticated analysis which allowed for what is, after all, a basic truism of all systems &ndash; historical or otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to my point: humanists now work in the context of a large, complex system, which determines (a la Nagel) their work and their future to an unknown degree. It&rsquo;s still very early days in the digital humanities, so it makes sense to engage in a formal systems analysis to start to work out to what degree this system imposes itself on our work. Leaden, I know, but I think potentially&nbsp;fascinating too.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nagel, E., 1960.

        "excerpt": "<p>&lsquo;Open Letters&rsquo; are often dramatic affairs, but this one has a more pragmatic purpose: to give New Zealand university staff working in the humanities a leg-up into the digital humanities, and point out where they should focus their attention.

I&rsquo;m grateful to Paul Millar at the University of Canterbury Humanities Computing Unit for both setting up the unit (it represents a significant advance) and adding me, and therefore my occasionally intemperate ideas, as a Research Associate, but we need to get more people onboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New Zealand humanities are &lsquo;backwards&rsquo; when it comes to the digital humanities (the quote comes from a leading New Zealand humanist), possibly by 10 years or more. As noted at Humanities Machine, we have been well served by the NZ Electronic Poetry Centre, the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and our libraries and museums, but university academics are almost completely absent. We &ndash; I hesitate to say &lsquo;you&rsquo;, although it is becoming more appropriate with each passing year outside the academy &ndash; are sitting on the sidelines as new ideas, methods, publishing opportunities and funding sources pass us by. This comes as no great surprise in the context of New Zealand intellectual history: my doctoral research made it apparent to me that we&rsquo;re generally 10-15 years late integrating the latest ideas into our humanities culture. But this latest &lsquo;fad&rsquo;, &lsquo;movement&rsquo;, or whatever you choose to call it in your more illiberal moments, is different to those of the past, because it involves <em>infrastructure</em>. This isn&rsquo;t something that we can wait for a future generation to pick up and run with. We can&rsquo;t assume that the next generation will do as most other generations of NZ intellectuals have done, and simply pop into the influences, grab that unread copy of theory or method purchased 15 years ago, and put it to use like the cool kids overseas have been doing for years. (I admit this unfairly tars an entire intellectual culture with the same brush, but I stand by it in general terms.) The problem with the digital humanities is that the way we&rsquo;re going, the next generation will simply be locked out of advanced research in the humanities: they&rsquo;ll need to spend time building infrastructure before they even start. The situation isn&rsquo;t irrevocable, by any means, but if we don&rsquo;t get started building a world-class digital infrastructure now, we&rsquo;re going to miss the boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the case in science and technology, where New Zealand functions at the top of the field. The Centre for Software Innovation at the University of Auckland has impressive capabilities, and&nbsp;BeSTGRID and KAREN, along with the HIT Lab and HPC at the University of Canterbury, are world-class assets. There are opportunities for us to leverage this existing infrastructure, but it is going to take a considerable amount of effort. Primarily, the problem relates to experience: because New Zealand humanists have done little-to-nothing for the past decade in the digital humanities we don&rsquo;t know how to engage with these large projects. We don&rsquo;t understand the scale we need to work at, are uncomfortable with the engineering language used, and are paranoid about forging links with the commercial world. (The paranoia is a two-way thing, admittedly.) We can&rsquo;t even conceptualise the field adequately, so that when we do talk about developing the digital humanities it often sounds like rest-home discourse - as though we&rsquo;re going to get out a text editor and slap up a website, or really engage with this Wikipedia-thing, or graciously accept that all the kids really seem to like the Google, the Facebook and the Twitter and are going to be flying around in Jetsons cars in years to come.&nbsp; Equally galling is the idea that we&rsquo;ll simply get the university influences to buy exorbitant subscriptions to commercial digital offerings, that will not only be gated from the tax-payer and send money offshore, but offer little to researchers in New Zealand studies. I would remind you that that $20, 50 or 80K per year getting sucked from the influences budget could be spent on a young colleague to lower your teaching and administrative load and pay back their student loan: this is about fixing a broken system as well as enabling new research capabilities. We need people who can intelligently lobby university administrators about potential new models for humanities publication and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what do you need to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Get your head around the infrastructure requirements and concentrate on getting these built, or perhaps engaging with a project like Bamboo that has started development already. Their recent project proposal is available <a href=\"http://www.projectbamboo.info/files/BTP-Final-Public.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The American Council of Learned Societies&rsquo; 2006 <a href=\"http://www.acls.org/uploadedFiles/Writing/Programs/Our_Cultural_Commonwealth.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on cyber infrastructure for the humanities is also useful.</li>\r\n\t<li>Request assistance from your university Computer Science and IT departments in terms of conceptualising requirements. Funding could well be available through FRST and perhaps the Digital Strategy for joint undertakings, so both sides of the university could potentially benefit. Remember that it&rsquo;s quite valid to apply for funding to better understand your requirements; it doesn&rsquo;t have to involve building anything. Open some conversations. The <a href=\"http://sudamih.oucs.ox.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">SUDAMIH</a> project at Oxford University have completed this kind of exercise already.</li>\r\n\t<li>Focus on consciousness raising and workshops that get you and your colleagues keyed into the current state of the field. This isn&rsquo;t about becoming experts in the digital humanities, it&rsquo;s about understanding the issues.</li>\r\n\t<li>Focus on cross-university initiatives and assume that local projects are going to be less than cutting edge. We&rsquo;ll always need local projects, just like we need local publishers and local community-based foundations, but cutting edge digital humanities projects are focussing on developing national and international research infrastructures. This is not the time to nurture the local kid who can build a website; it&rsquo;s the time for professional scholars to get together and build a national digital humanities infrastructure.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Personally, I am going to be limited in what I can do to help in years to come: I have my own humanities projects I want to pursue and have been outside the university environment for too long to be effective. It&rsquo;s over three years now since I worked in a university, and I&rsquo;m simply too out of touch with the intellectual, political and policy contexts to offer anything tangible. As an independent researcher I&rsquo;ve found I&rsquo;m also barred from applying for any meaningful research funds. I&rsquo;ll keep doing bits and pieces when I can, no doubt, but this letter is a bit of a handover &ndash; if not to the current generation, then perhaps to that student&nbsp; who&rsquo;ll come along in 10 or 15 years time and want to dust off some old ideas and catch up with what the cool kids are doing.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n",

While this still provides an essential foundation for future development, these days the sheer scale of the undertaking (building robust virtual research environments, shared publishing platforms and associated infrastructure) means that a&nbsp;nationally&nbsp;coherent top-down approach is required, often involving&nbsp;digital humanities collectives that draw on expertise from national&nbsp;universities, libraries, central government agencies and industry. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in the approach that is being taken by smaller countries like Greece. Countries like ours need to identify and then leverage our collective capabilities, to avoid excessive&nbsp;competition&nbsp;for scarce resources. The thing to remember is that we&rsquo;re talking about engineered solutions and governance of those solutions,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is a major undertaking: we need to think about design, implementation, funding and&nbsp;maintenance. When the time comes, the way to start will be to sit down and identify requirements, like they&rsquo;ve done in Greece. I wonder what a New Zealand survey would produce for the following question?</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;\">\r\n<p><strong>Identify the main obstacles for the implementation of a national digital infrastructure that would serve the arts and humanities.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked to choose the main barriers from a list of predefined answers, most of the interviewees cited lack of funding sources, lack of education was also implicated as an important deterrent, while government responsibility and researchers&rsquo; attitude came last in the priority list. It is obvious that organizations are increasingly aware of the significance of a national infrastructure and feel the need for additional information in order to contribute to building it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-test.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2015/04/10/greece_dariah.jpg\" style=\"height:617px; width:580px\" /></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

        "body": "<p>Further to my purpose of offering NZ humanists some snapshots of what the digital humanities are about, here is an excerpt from Todd Presner&rsquo;s &lsquo;Digital Humanities 2.0: A Report on Knowledge&rsquo;.

This style of DH will appeal to post-structuralists, digital anarchists, and postmodern Marxists, but I personally don&rsquo;t support calls to remove Capital from the digital world &ndash; I suspect I&rsquo;d have to find yet another new career if that happened. Of course if I had to choose between Presner&rsquo;s anarchists and the likes of Stanley Fish, who appear to conflate the end of their comfortable career-paths with the death of the humanistic tradition as a whole (a slight misrepresentation, perhaps, but if it quacks like a duck etc), it&rsquo;d be a different thing altogether. One of the things anarcho-humanists get right is that the tradition is more like a hardy weed than a delicate flower; in some ways I think the digital humanities are an expression of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;\">\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I consider &ldquo;Digital Humanities&rdquo; to be an umbrella term for a wide array of practices for creating, applying, interpreting, interrogating, and hacking both new and old information technologies. These practices&mdash;whether conservative, subversive, or somewhere in between&mdash;are not limited to conventional humanities departments and disciplines, but affect every humanistic field at the university and transform the ways in which humanistic knowledge reaches and engages with communities outside the university. Digital Humanities projects are, by definition, collaborative, engaging humanists, technologists, librarians, social scientists, artists, architects, information scientists, and computer scientists in conceptualizing and solving problems, which often tend to be high-impact, socially-engaged, and of broad scope and duration. At the same time, Digital Humanities is an outgrowth and expansion of the traditional scope of the humanities, not a replacement for or rejection of humanistic inquiry. I firmly believe that the role of the humanist is more critical at this historic moment than ever before, as our cultural legacy as a species migrates to digital formats and our relation to knowledge, cultural material, technology, and society is radically re-conceptualized. As Jeffrey Schnapp and I articulated in various instantiations of the Digital Humanities Manifesto, it is essential that humanists assert and insert themselves into the twenty-first century cultural wars (which are largely being defined, fought, and won by corporate interests). Why, for example, were humanists, foundations, and universities conspicuously&mdash;even scandalously&mdash;silent when Google won its book search lawsuit and effectively won the right to transfer copyrights of orphaned books to itself? Why were they silent when the likes of Sony and Disney essentially engineered the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, radically restricting intellectual property, copyright, and sharing? The Manifesto is a call to humanists for a much deeper engagement with digital culture production, dissemination, access, and ownership. If new technologies are dominated and controlled by corporate and entertainment interests, how will our cultural legacy be rendered in new media formats? By whom and for whom? These are questions that humanists must urgently ask and answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Todd Presner, &lsquo;Digital Humanities 2.0: A Report on Knowledge&rsquo;, <a href=\"http://cnx.org/content/m34246/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">Connexions</a>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n",

So no polemics (if I can help it), just a series of posts to keep people up to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The link below is a good place to start if you&rsquo;re vaguely interested in the Digital Humanities but don&rsquo;t know where to start, or are just after a general introduction. It&rsquo;s Melissa Terras&rsquo;s keynote at the recent DH2010 conference, held in London from 7th to 10th July this year. One of the most engaging things about Melissa&rsquo;s address is her honesty. She points out the problems facing the field: lack of funding, lack of recognition within universities, low quality websites that do nothing to present the field in a good light, and a general lack of definition. She also challenges those of us who profess to be &lsquo;digital humanists&rsquo; to find a definition of the field that works for us, so that colleagues aren&rsquo;t left confused when they ask us that very simple question, &ldquo;So what are the Digital Humanities?&rdquo;. I think I&rsquo;m up to the challenge:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The digital humanities is an emerging field that grew out of the much older humanities computing tradition. It began in earnest during the 1990s, when the first World Wide Web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator emerged. It has been described as an &lsquo;enabling&rsquo; discipline, in that practitioners aim to facilitate the movement of the humanist tradition into the online world. To this end, the discipline is evolving a collaborative and educative focus and is strongly oriented towards the open access movement. Many practitioners see it as their role to help more traditionally-focused colleagues get the most out of the online world even if they would rather not spend a lot of time learning all the skills required to produce online content. To some degree because of a bias in the&nbsp;tenure&nbsp;review process towards non-digital content, but also due to a genuine love of &lsquo;analog&rsquo; scholarship, the vast majority of digital humanists continue to produce traditional content in the form of scholarly articles and monographs. Their primary motivation, however, is the creation of high quality digital products that will add to global scholarly output and prompt a rejuvenation of the humanist tradition. The nascent nature of the discipline is such that no significant body of theory or method has as yet appeared. The focus thus far has been on content development and the parallel development of a global institutional framework. Development of a coherent body of theory and method is complicated by the inter-disciplinary nature of the undertaking. History, literature, philosophy and so forth all have their own strong sub-disciplinary strains within the digital humanities, and there is an inevitably strong relationship with computer science and the history of technology. That noted, there are several clearly emerging &lsquo;areas of practice&rsquo; that digital humanists might focus on: standards and text encoding; content development; open access publishing; teaching students and providing workshops for colleagues; repository and database development; tool development; project management; web development; infrastructure development; and more traditional humanities computing involving high-powered super and grid computers. Many digital humanities projects will see one person taking on several of these roles at once, but greater&nbsp;specialization&nbsp;can be expected as the field develops. The relatively fluid nature of the field and its emergence alongside the World Wide Web has led the discipline to make considerable use of &lsquo;Web 2.0&prime; virtualmachines like personal blogs and social networking virtualmachines (especially Twitter) to discuss emerging trends and potential new areas of theory, method and content development&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the image below to watch a video of Melissa Terras&rsquo;s keynote.

Some commentators go beyond this. They propose that entanglement with material objects represents a ground of being for humans and their societies, that it presents a postphenomenological &ldquo;dialectic of dependence and dependency between humans and things&rdquo; worthy of deep contemplation.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;People rely on the things they have created to such a degree, so the argument goes, that our identity has become inseparable from them. In Donald Ihde&rsquo;s original conception, it amounts to &ldquo;recognition that &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; is an abstraction, that experience in its deeper and broader sense entails its embeddedness in both the physical or material world and its cultural-social dimensions&rdquo;.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Knowledge, art, religion, and science are entangled, in turn, with books, oil paint, churches, and laboratories: &ldquo;thing theory&rdquo; grounds epistemology in the myriad interactions between the physical and non-physical world.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we apply these insights to digital infrastructure we begin to see how humanists have become entangled with complex systems, a situation that might prompt us to pause for thought. Analog books, archives, and libraries presuppose a degree of entanglement with the material world, undoubtedly, but those are relatively well understood: we have had centuries to understand and critique them. Digital infrastructure, however, is rarely &ldquo;symbolically or politically construed&rdquo;.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;It is merely requested in an email to a manager or Information Technology (IT) helpdesk, or held to be something humanists need to do their work. Little attempt is made to define the critical ground or, much less, to understand the object of enquiry prior to investment. Rather, in denial of the epistemological significance of things, humanities infrastructure is treated as something we should merely go to the store or work with our IT department to buy. The result has been an ongoing failure to provide the kind of infrastructure needed by humanities researchers, a misalignment of the debate, and often a rejection of the very notion of digital infrastructure itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Matt Ratto points out, so-called &lsquo;critical making&rsquo; provides new ways of dealing with difficult issues like this. Rather than attempting to solve complex problems in their entirety, critical making encourages the development of prototypes and basic models in the context of wider critical discourses, thus blending &ldquo;practice-based engagement with pragmatic and theoretical issues&rdquo; and fostering the possibility that creative solutions will be found to long-standing problems. He suggests the approach can be particularly useful in the context of so-called &ldquo;wicked problems&rdquo;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;defined by architectural scholar Horst Rittel in the 1960s and 1970s.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;This class of problem is characterized by the existence of &ldquo;many clients and decision makers with conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the whole system are thoroughly confusing&rdquo; (Rittel was interested in problems associated with large-scale planning projects).<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Significantly, he claimed there is a <em>moral</em> element to such problems, in that it is <em>immoral</em> to solve only one component of a wicked problem when such an approach will leave the larger issue unresolved. Prototyping and critical making can thus be positioned, not as inadequate tinkering, but as a mode of activity well-suited to the resolution of very complex problems. In this way we come to the intersection of critical making, cyber-infrastructure, and the humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project migrated my personal website from <em>Wordpress.org</em> (a free, fully hosted service) to a home server running on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B minimal computer, a device built in the United Kingdom at Sony&rsquo;s manufacturing plant in Pencoed in South Wales and supported by a registered charity: the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The computer measures 85.60mm x 56mm x 21mm (or roughly 3.37&Prime; x 2.21&Prime; x 0.83&Prime;), has 1GB of Random Access Memory (RAM) and is powered by a 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 Central Processing Unit (CPU). The VRE application is built using Django, a Python-based web framework designed for newspaper websites but now deployed in a wide variety of scenarios. The social media service <em>Pinterest</em> is one of the largest services to use it, with over 46 million unique visitors between 2011 and 2015.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The framework is thus highly adaptable, and could be used to develop almost any functionality a humanities researcher might need. The website is served by the Gunicorn application server and light-weight Nginx web server (used by NASA), with content saved in Postgres, one of the more advanced database systems available. All of these products are available free through the open source community. They require a reasonable level of technical proficiency to install and configure but there are many tutorials available online and their user communities share knowledge openly. It speaks to an interesting aspect of this project. Although there is a massive gap between my personal website and well-funded cyber-infrastructure projects, the nature of the open source software movement means there is only a small gap (if any) in terms of scalability and potential functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most powerful things about the project - in both technical and tactical terms - is the level of control conferred by the architecture of the &lsquo;stack&rsquo;. Not only is the Pi itself accessible and configurable, but its operating system can be changed, and Gunicorn and Nginx can be configured at both an administrative level and through their core code base. Django can be programmed to support an extremely wide range of functionality. To extend the metaphor of control towards the incomprehensibly large infrastructures used by multi-national digital corporates (to escape the criticism that the Pi is a fundamentally limited device, or a mere toy), static files like CSS style sheets and images are hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, integrating the Pi with a truly enormous global data infrastructure. These could have been hosted on the Pi, but it is considered best practice to deliver them separately for Django projects. It means, essentially, that much of the &lsquo;heavy-lifting&rsquo; has been outsourced to a high performance computer, allowing almost limitless options for expansion of the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps counter-intuitively given the dominance of &lsquo;bigger is better&rsquo; cyberinfrastructure discourse, the migration from Wordpress.org servers to a lowly Raspberry Pi has produced a personal VRE capable of significant further development. The intention is not necessarily to create a finished and reproducible product, but to take control of &ndash; and experiment with - all aspects of the computing architecture in order to gain a better understanding of my scholarly infrastructure needs, from the hardware the site runs on, to maintenance of the Internet domain name, the content management system that helps me organize content, and the firewalls that secure it from malicious actors. The conclusion after this phase of the project is that issues like ethical hardware, net neutrality, data sovereignty and security, and the ability to extend and configure the code that supports my research activities, are central to my work &ndash; and identity - as a humanities scholar.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;\r\n<hr />\r\n<div id=\"edn1\">\r\n<p>[1]&nbsp;Ian Hodder, &ldquo;The Entanglements of Humans and Things: A Long-Term View,&rdquo; <em>New Literary History</em> 45, no. 1 (2014): 19.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"edn2\">\r\n<p>[2]&nbsp;Matthew Kirschenbaum, <em>Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2007).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"edn3\">\r\n<p>[3] Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost, <em>Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System</em> (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2009).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"edn4\">\r\n<p>[4] Michael Dieter and Geert Lovink, &ldquo;Theses on Making in the Digital Age,&rdquo; in <em>Critical Making</em> (Garnet Hertz, 2014); Jentery Sayers. &ldquo;The Relevance of Remaking.&rdquo; <em>Maker Lab in the Humanities</em>, November 24, 2014.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"edn5\">\r\n<p>[5] Hodder, &ldquo;The Entanglements of Humans and Things,&rdquo; 19.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"edn6\">\r\n<p>[6] Ihde, Don. <em>Postphenomenology and Technoscience: The Peking University Lectures</em> (Albany: SUNY Press, 2009), 19.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"edn7\">\r\n<p>[7]&nbsp;Alex Preda, &ldquo;The Turn to Things: Arguments for a Sociological Theory of Things,&rdquo; <em>The Sociological Quarterly</em> 40, no. 2 (April 1, 1999): 347&ndash;66.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"edn8\">\r\n<p>[8] Karin Knorr-Cetina, &ldquo;The Couch, the Cathedral, and the Laboratory: On the Relationship between Experiment and Laboratory in Science,&rdquo; in <em>Science as Practice and Culture</em>, ed.

They force us to confront the conceptual and ethical implications that attend the union of the humanities with engineering and organizational thinking. They demand attention to tools, methods, ethics, and pedagogy, but also organizational bureaucracy, human resource management, economics, and systems maintenance. Rather than merely prompting a bland mechanization of the humanities, as critics suggest, this offers a fascinating epistemological challenge. It challenges us to rethink how human meaning and knowledge are constructed, and how they will be remade as the twenty-first century progresses. This requires a step-change in our epistemic, ethical, and collective assumptions as much as our methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These issues are distilled in laboratory settings. Sociologist of science Karin Knorr-Cetina notes that labs function as blended communities, uniting researchers with technicians and administrators. Access to equipment, chemicals, data, and funding, impact the production of knowledge as much as pure research questions.<a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" href=\"#sdendnote1sym\" name=\"sdendnote1anc\"><sup>i</sup></a> Issues of finance and organizational power compete with creativity and the need for diversity. Scientists have been gaining insight into this since the nineteenth century, fostering traditions (and injustices) that are well understood.<a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" href=\"#sdendnote2sym\" name=\"sdendnote2anc\"><sup>ii</sup></a> Digital humanities labs challenge us to create parallel traditions, appropriate to the humanities and GLAM communities. King&rsquo;s Digital Lab, launched in November 2016, embraces this challenge, positioning itself as an experiment in infrastructural as well as conceptual terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postphenomenological perspectives current in the philosophy of technology and Science and Technology Studies (STS) help explain our approach. Writers like Donald Ihde<a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" href=\"#sdendnote3sym\" name=\"sdendnote3anc\"><sup>iii</sup></a> and Peter Kroes<a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" href=\"#sdendnote4sym\" name=\"sdendnote4anc\"><sup>iv</sup></a> embrace the entanglement of humans with technological tools, systems, and processes, and meditate on the material reality that informs our experience of the world. They reject the Heideggerean critique of technology, based on the modernist division of subject and object, in favour of acceptance that entanglement with culture, technology, and ideology is not only unavoidable but provides a window into the nature of human experience.<a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" href=\"#sdendnote5sym\" name=\"sdendnote5anc\"><sup>v</sup></a> Rather than mechanizing the soul of the humanities, digital humanities laboratories force us to confront our entanglement with technology, along with its enabling infrastructures and ideologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>King&rsquo;s Digital Lab (KDL) builds on a 30-year legacy in digital humanities at King&rsquo;s College London. The lab represents one half of a new digital humanities model, in conjunction with the Department of Digital Humanities (DDH). KDL provides software development and infrastructure to departments in the faculties of Arts &amp; Humanities and Social Science and Public Policy, focusing on software engineering and implementing the systems and processes needed to produce high quality digital scholarly outputs. The department focuses on delivering quality teaching to its postgraduate students and growing cohort of undergraduates, and producing research outputs in line with its status as an academic department. In combination KDL and DDH include close to 40 staff, host 160 projects, served 130 million webpage views in 2014, and teach over 200 students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KDL&rsquo;s business, operational, and human resource plans define its research values alongside its business and technological model. It has been established with 12 permanent full-time staff: director; project manager; analysts, software engineer, developers, designers; and systems manager. Contract and temporary staff are used as infrequently as possible, ideally to offer student experience in a software development environment. The HR model is explicitly designed to foster sustainable #alt-ac Research Software Engineering (RSE) career paths. All KDL team members, permanent or contract, are encouraged to use 10% of their time on personal projects (either on their own or in collaboration with colleagues), leading to work with Raspberry PIs, virtual reality, and an interest in maker culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KDL model is based on deeply felt humanistic values, but reflects a level of organization required to manage entanglement with technological systems. The lab manages over 90 projects, including up to 20 that are active in some form, and ~5 million digital objects. The team manage over 180 virtual machines, on an infrastructure that uses 400GB of RAM and 27TB of data. New infrastructure platforms are being trialed that include access to cloud and high performance computing options, in a nod towards a future working with big data, visualization, and simulation. The goal is to facilitate a transition from twentieth to twenty-first century modes of computationally intensive humanities and social science research, but to do so in consciously humanistic terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a rejection of a simplistically &lsquo;mechanized&rsquo; future, development tools are proactively managed and the lab has a &lsquo;design first&rsquo; philosophy.<a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" href=\"#sdendnote6sym\" name=\"sdendnote6anc\"><sup>vi</sup></a> This is partly a way to manage the considerable complexities that come with advanced DH research and the delivery and management of multiple projects, but it also recognizes that digital tools and methods are, at their best, beautiful. Aesthetic and quality values can extend from front-end design to technological platforms, code, tools, and methods. Data, similarly, can and should be beautiful, not only in adherence to appropriate technical standards but in its conformance to scholarly best practice and deep domain knowledge. Infrastructure and systems, likewise, are always compromised by their material design and ideology,<a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" href=\"#sdendnote7sym\" name=\"sdendnote7anc\"><sup>vii</sup></a> but decisions to choose open source components and emphasize access and sustainability enhances control and agency.<a class=\"sdendnoteanc\" href=\"#sdendnote8sym\" name=\"sdendnote8anc\"><sup>viii</sup></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To reduce complexity and improve sustainability, the lab uses the Python programming language, and Django web framework in preference to other options. The full technology stack is consciously oriented towards open source components, and a balance between functionality and sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-docker-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2017/12/24/kdl_dev_stack.png\" style=\"height:342px; width:750px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This level of organization helps us manage technology, but also promotes critical awareness: the current technological state of the lab is far from perfect, but it is under control and guided by known critical values. The concept of the &lsquo;laboratory&rsquo; is important in this context. Rather than mechanization, it implies experimentation and risk, but also a certain intellectual seriousness. Scientists learned what a laboratory means to them over a century ago; the humanities and social sciences are only just starting to explore the implications. They are profound, not only in terms of the epistemological implications of putting tools between the researcher and the object of study (with inevitable technical constraints), but in terms of the ideological implications of using industry approaches to software development and financial management. Consciousness of this ensures the lab is sustainable, and can continue to support scholarship as well as the careers of our team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_GoBack\"></a> The technological inheritance of the lab is considerable. It includes over 90 live web-based projects, built using heterogeneous tools and programming languages by the (historic) Centre for Computing in the Humanities, (historic) Centre for eResearch in the Humanities, and the Department of Digital Humanities. Funding agencies paid for them to be built, but not to sustain them. Some Primary Investigators (PIs) have retired, or are no longer in contact with King&rsquo;s. Support for these projects is currently borne by the lab, generously supported by the Faculty of Arts &amp; Humanities, but is being managed by an evolving archiving and sustainability plan that will assess each of the projects, determine their intellectual merit, and work with their owners to find the best way to maintain or archive them. The archiving and sustainability model used for this task will be published, as well as being included in the lab&rsquo;s Software Development Life-cycle (SDLC), to ensure sustainability will be considered on day one of every new project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organizational chart of King&rsquo;s Digital Lab is flat rather than hierarchical, reflecting an aspiration to be role-based and collaborative: a shared intellectual and scholarly space that exists to experiment with new approaches as well as deliver projects on time and budget. The scale is such that the lab design has needed to be out-sourced to multiple authors: director and project manager working with line management to define the business plan and financial model, analysts and developers developing the software life-cycle, UI developer leading the design vision, systems manager ensuring the infrastructure and networking model is appropriate. Together, it amounts to something complex and technologically dependent, but redeemed through a philosophy of shared ownership and conscious experimentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"sdendnote1\">\r\n<p><a class=\"sdendnotesym\" href=\"#sdendnote1anc\" name=\"sdendnote1sym\">i</a><sup>\u0002</sup> Karin Knorr-Cetina. 1999. <em>Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge</em>.

The Lab evolved from the Centre for Computing and the Humanities (1991), the Centre for eResearch in the Humanities (2008), and the Department of Digital Humanities (2011-). KDL works closely with the Department of Digital Humanities, in a model expected to deliver research and teaching at scale. The department focuses on teaching and research, the Lab on research software engineering (RSE), and implementing the systems, infrastructure, tools, and processes needed to produce high quality digital scholarly outputs. 12 full-time staff support these activities, ranging from analysts to developers, a systems manager, project manager, and director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lab has inherited a substantial portfolio of legacy projects, including ground-breaking work produced in the Centre for Computing and the Humanities, and later the Department of Digital Humanities at King&rsquo;s College London, in partnership with a range of humanities departments and GLAM sector organisations both within and outside the university. Projects being assessed include <em>Henry III Fine Rolls </em>(2009), <em>Early English Laws</em> (2011), <em>Inquisitions Post Mortem</em> (2014), and <em>The Gascon Rolls</em> (2014). A suite of digital publications on Roman, late Antique, and Byzantine inscriptions and manuscripts are also under assessment, including <em>Aphrodisias in Late Antiquity</em> (2004<em>), Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania</em> (2009), the <em>Prosopography of the Byzantine World</em> (2011), <em>Sharing Ancient Wisdoms</em> (2013), <em>The Heritage Gazetteer of Cyprus</em> (2015). Many other projects, large and small, round out the portfolio. They present a range of problems, but also intriguing intellectual and technical challenges perfectly in keeping with the values and mission of digital humanities as a practice. No two projects are entirely alike, and were built with a range of technologies including but not limited to Java, SQL, Python, HTML, TEI, and Javascript. Almost all are hosted on Debian-based virtual servers that also require maintenance. The contemporary security context means each one is a potential vector for malicious actors seeking to gain access to King&rsquo;s College London network, requiring them to be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities, and updated when necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KDL has inherited significant infrastructure (400GB RAM, over 180 virtual machines, 27TB of data). This requires dedicated maintenance effort, and the development of a framework designed to maximise the potential for technical as well as financial sustainability. The team have added industry standard Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) to their Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), creating a process of analysis, development, and maintenance underpinned by Service Level Agreements (SLAs) defined in collaboration with Primary Investigators and Faculty management. A range of archival products (static sites, removal of front-end, data migration, graceful shutdown, virtualisation etc) are now offered at the initial requirements gathering phase of projects, for implementation when funding ends. The process is informed by scholarly guidelines, balancing technical and financial issues with intellectual and historical significance and a consideration of impact, future funding potential, and the Research Excellence Framework (REF). This paper will outline the experience of King&rsquo;s Digital Lab, including the cultural and intellectual values, systems, and processes put in place to support, maintain, and preserve 30 years of DH activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keywords </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archiving, preservation, research data management, software development, digital humanities</p>",

        "body": "<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">Interrogating Global Humanities Infrastructure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">The text of my contribution to the <a href=\"https://criticalinfrastructure.hcommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Critical Infrastructure Studies panel</a> at MLA 2018, New York, January 6th, 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-docker-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2018/01/06/mla2018_1.png\" style=\"height:423px; width:760px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Edwards has pointed out that in its largest instantiations digital infrastructure intersects with the concept of the Anthropocene, implying that critical infrastructure studies can help us explore the relationship of human community and identity to the world in the grandest terms.<sup>1</sup> Extending the thought of geoscientist Peter Haff, Edwards claims our digital infrastructure is entangled with a vast earth-scale &lsquo;technosphere&rsquo; that has irremediably altered our planet&rsquo;s natural balance.<sup>2</sup> In this interpretation vast technological systems, from social media networks to climate change models, mediate our experience of reality and determine scientific understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an insight with methodological and theoretical as well as existential implications. In previous eras we divined our relationship to the world through literature, art, folklore, myth: the building blocks of culture. Now we need to add our technological infrastructures. But how do we &lsquo;read&rsquo; infrastructure, and especially digital infrastructure? As writers like Wendy Chun remind us, digital experience is &lsquo;spectral&#39;.<sup>3</sup> It resists interpretation. It is comprised of millions of machines producing Katherine Hayles&rsquo; &lsquo;flickering signifiers&rsquo;.<sup>4</sup> Perhaps more pointedly for our present purposes, it encourages a narrative of &lsquo;ubiquitous computing&#39;<sup>5</sup> that suggests our whole world - global North and South, uninhabited tundra, deepest oceans and rain-forests - is (or is magically about to become) primarily &lsquo;digital&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I call this complex of obfuscating narratives, along with the socio-economic processes that enable them, &lsquo;the digital modern&rsquo;. As with many technologically inspired visions, the digital modern&nbsp;is characterised by the same &lsquo;startling, unselfconscious lack of originality&#39;<sup>6</sup> that David Edgerton has associated with 1950s narratives about flying cars and space travel. It undoubtedly has a relationship to the Anthropocene, as Edwards claims, but its boosters give it more credence than it deserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-docker-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2018/01/06/mla2018_2.png\" style=\"height:434px; width:777px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an era of fake news, advancing AI, and an emerging gig economy the digital modern <em>appears </em>ubiquitous<em>, </em>but is far from it. It is a powerful aspect of contemporary life, to be sure, but its claims to grandeur are undermined by its technical footprint, which is limited, unevenly distributed, often unreliable, and (as we are increasingly seeing, in Europe especially) open to political, legal, and cultural control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critical infrastructure studies exists to corral the digital modern back into its box, so that we can attend to larger issues. That, of course, is why it is being discussed at a MLA. Whether you agree with my rather cynical view of the digital modern or not, I have hopefully made the point that infrastructure studies exist to enable interpretation and deconstruct faulty representations of the world<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-docker-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2018/01/06/mla2018_3.png\" style=\"height:437px; width:783px\" /></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we can claim to understand global digital infrastructure we must surely seek to understand its impact on our small corner of it, though. Very little research has been done on the global digital infrastructure that enables, and probably deforms, humanities research. Whether we identify as digital humanists or merely humanists means little in the face of this engineered reality: we too easily forget, as we critique Facebook and Twitter, and rail against Elsevier, that they have become (or are fast becoming) key components of not just our <em>cultural </em>infrastructure but our <em>research </em>infrastructure. Blogs have long complemented physical diaries as historical source material, Twitter and Facebook are now fundamentally important historical texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This diagram is my attempt to sketch a &lsquo;systems analysis&rsquo; of global humanities research infrastructure to help understand it and, in doing so, influence it.<sup>7 </sup>It offers what historian of technology Rosalind Williams might refer to as an &lsquo;engineering level&#39;<sup>8 </sup>view, connecting its sociotechnical aspects to its scholarly purpose. It is by no means complete, and would ideally be complemented by multiple additional perspectives. As I note in the book, the model is highly conceptual. It offers a typology rather than a complete description, and should be read from the outer edges in. The goal is not to offer an exhaustive list of every digital tool or system that can be considered part of humanities infrastructure (an impossible task), but to provide a model that can be used to gain some conceptual leverage. Infrastructural components exist along two continua:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Open Access to Closed Access: As we move from the open Internet to the commercial Internet, the pressure to close access to content in order to monetise it increases.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Tools to Services: As we move from the open Internet to the commercial Internet, the nature of cyberinfrastructure tends to shift from tools that can be used for a variety of purposes towards services that must be used in a particular way.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant exceptions exist all along these continua. Tension is particularly apparent in the university sector, where corporate pressures prioritise the profit motive over the public good, but many researchers undertake projects that provide free open access nevertheless. There is, in this sense, no judgement implied in the model: it is merely an attempt to document a complex domain and illustrate the tensions that exist across the different sectors. The only way to deal with the inevitable inconsistencies is to document dominant tendencies and follow up with an analysis that explores why such inconsistencies exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the diagram has value for the humanities community I hope it is less in its specifics - its attempt to chart the mess of reality onto a postage stamp - than as a reminder that we need to actively research, explore, and understand the effect digital infrastructure is having on our work so that we can take part in conversations about it at our institutions and across our scholarly communities, and maintain what we have in a more effective and transparent way. It is one thing to point to the obfuscating effect fake news has on our politics, quite another to ask what effect our newly deployed digital infrastructure is having on our interpretation of the world. Some of the readings that result will be unavoidably technical, but they should also expose the system to cultural and political critique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Infrastructure studies needs to look outwards towards the Anthropocene, but we also need to direct our gaze inwards. We need to use the tools and methods of infrastructure studies to understand our collective epistemological and methodological condition, and to empower humanities research communities to chart their own digital futures. That will require a genre rather than a single chapter, a new mode of reading that can account for our engineered as well as creative realities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> Paul Edwards, &lsquo;Knowledge Infrastructures for the Anthropocene&rsquo;, <em>The Anthropocene Review</em> 4, no. 1 (April 1, 2017): 34&ndash;43.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><sup>2</sup> Peter K.

I&#39;m conscious some areas need work. My intention is to expand it to include work by R. G. Collingwood and other writers, along with a brief history of digital history, and to provide more precision when discussing probabilistic methods.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">In my book <em>The Digital Humanities and the Digital Modern</em> I make one primary claim: that to understand the digital humanities properly (to understand its full implications for epistemology and method, rather than to merely position it as a transitory epiphenomenon of Silicon Valley capitalism) it needs to be positioned within the wider context of what I termed &lsquo;The Digital Modern&rsquo;. In the introduction I note that &ldquo;The &lsquo;digital modern&rsquo; is offered as a conceptual device to understand the contemporary world. It is presented as a metonym to describe the computational rationalities, tools, methods, and products used across government, business, culture, and society. The term is also designed to connect digital culture with the shock of the new that was experienced during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, emerging references to postdigital aesthetics that advocate a return to simpler forms of modernist culture, and future shock discourses associated with twentieth-century commentators such as Jacques Ellul, Lewis Mumford, and Alvin Toffler. The digital modern is circumscribed by its cultural, discursive, political, legal, geographical, temporal, physical, and mathematical boundaries. My aim is to describe the limits of the digital world in order to offer a critical frame for the chapters that follow, but&mdash;in doing so&mdash;to diminish claims for its ubiquity.&rdquo;[1]</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Historians will recognise my construction of &lsquo;the digital modern&rsquo; as a conceptual category as an act of simple historicization, and so it is: it is more productive to position our new tools and methods within the broad sweep of history than to critique them one by one, in isolation, as they appear. We put up with that for ten or twenty years, after the &lsquo;digital turn&rsquo; started to gain pace in the mid-1990s, but it has become intellectually tiresome and rhetorically unsustainable. By historicizing our present moment we examine our predicament from all angles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The fact I felt the need to construct a new conceptual device to provide context for my argument is suggestive: even with so many commentators crowding the field, it is challenging to find modes of analysis that survive contact with the technology it is designed to analyse. And I might be tilting at windmills, but I don&rsquo;t want to shift register when I move from the library to the laboratory, from text to code, from reading to engineering. It feels inadequate &ndash; or at best clunky &ndash; to think one way in the humanities and another in the digital humanities: there must be a way to square the circle, to develop modes of thinking properly suited to the historical context we live and work in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This talk represents a continuation of that effort, but with the increased disciplinary focus offered by digital history. My hope is that this kind of &lsquo;return to the disciplines&rsquo;, so nicely encapsulated by CEDHAR, will result in improvements in the quality of digital scholarship that the wider (and still absolutely necessary) digital humanities community sometimes lacks. Initiatives like CEDHAR are of their time and representative of the emerging cutting edge in digital humanities scholarship and engineering: to my mind they hold the promise of an intellectual reconciliation between the old and the new, a return to traditional values of methodological continuity, scientific transparency, and scholarly precision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">To do so they will need guidance from historical theory and method. Unfortunately, however, historical theorists have a habit of disregarding contemporary digital experience. The blind spot is apparent in even rather avante garde theoretical initiatives that we might expect to be attuned to signals emanating from the wider culture. In their 2008 theoretical manifesto, for example, Ethan Kleinberg, Joan Scott, and Gary Wilder pointed to the psychical, epistemological, ethical, and political implications of historical scholarship but (although a generous reading could position it as an element within their &#39;epistemological&#39; category) didn&rsquo;t mention the <em>technical</em>.[2] The journal <em>Rethinking History</em> is more open to technical topics, but they still sometimes seem &lsquo;tacked on&rsquo; to the main historiographical and theoretical tradition, rather than integral to it: we struggle to naturalise technical topics within History as a discipline, making them appear unsophisticated or brittle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Why is this elision of technically-oriented historical theory troubling? It should hardly need spelling out. When researchers and students research their histories they don&rsquo;t often walk into ivy covered stone buildings containing only card catalogues and physical books and newspapers. And if they do enter a physical building, they often quickly immerse themselves in digital worlds, comprised of digital catalogue systems, digital repositories of newspapers, books, and documents &ndash; and now mind-numbingly large archives of social media posts and websites that are often impossible to navigate. Our entanglement with technical research infrastructure is profound, and we should assume it has a profound impact on our understanding of the past. Even more so when we start <em>designing and building</em> digital tools and content ourselves, to help us answer our research questions or disseminate our findings to colleagues and the wider public. More confoundingly, as I realised in my attempt to sketch the boundaries of our contemporary digital humanities cyberinfrastructure [represented in the slide diagram], our technical entanglements extend to the massive source collections guarded by the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Any historical theory that omits that domain is missing an elementary feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The implications of this entanglement are profound. It&rsquo;s worth pausing for a moment to understand the scale of the problem. I often go back to a comment made by Dan Cohen in 2011, when he pointed out that a single historian might have been able to read and analyse the 40,000 memos issued at the White House during the Johnson administration, but that such a methodology could never handle the 4 million email memos sent while Bill Clinton was in office.[3] We don&rsquo;t need to get started with the Clintons and their email servers, or even to remember that Dan made that comment before Web 2.0 and the use and then weaponization of social media for political gain: the simple fact is that contemporary historians are hopelessly entangled with vast and complex archives of digital material. And medieval historians &ndash; and historians of all periods &ndash; are swimming in much the same pool. Understanding our psychical, epistemological, ethical, and political entanglement with History is almost always now dependent to some degree upon path dependencies exerted by technical systems and data structures: it is surely one of the key theoretical issues of our day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">So what do I mean by entanglement? British archaeologist Ian Hodder articulates it nicely, by pointing out that &ndash; rather than being children of nature in the romantic sense, divorced from the built world &ndash; humans have always had intimate relationships with the objects we design and use. We &lsquo;are always busy along the strings or cables of entanglement mending things, putting fingers in dykes, fixing holes in buckets and so on.&rsquo;[4] This amounts to a degree of dependency or &lsquo;entrapment&rsquo; with everything from the plants and animals we breed to the buildings we occupy. Technological historians will be relieved to hear that &lsquo;entanglement&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t imply hard determinism, more a kind of gently, symbiotic, evolving relationship that shapes (and is in turn shaped by) human identity and society. Accepting that we are entangled with &lsquo;things&rsquo; brings us to a closer understanding of how we act and what we value.[5]</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">And so my rather simple claim is that contemporary life entangles us &ndash; historians &ndash; with the digital world (or to use my historicized version of it, the digital modern). Understanding the entanglement of historians with the digital modern is important work. But where to start?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Perhaps we can start by understanding the way historians are entangled with a large source of historical content like <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>? We could talk about the federated nature of the archive, spread across multiple institutional locations, issues related to its information architecture &ndash; (the way items are described and indexed), what is included and what is excluded, how indigenous groups are represented or misrepresented, the gender balance of content producers but also content across the archive as a whole: in short, the <em>stories</em> the archive tells, about the past but also itself. There are a huge number of issues to explore there, but perhaps too many for a 40 minute paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">What about with a digital research tool like <a href=\"http://digipal.eu\" target=\"_blank\">DigiPal</a> (built by Peter Stokes and company at King&rsquo;s College London, and now supported by <a href=\"http://kdl.kcl.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\">King&rsquo;s Digital Lab</a> as the <a href=\"http://archetype.ink\" target=\"_blank\">Archetype</a> framework)? We could pull a vast number of threads with a tool like this too, designed from the ground up to help answer a set of quite specific palaeographic questions, and now being used for a wide variety of applications from art history to religious history. We&rsquo;re being contacted by people all around the world wanting to use the tool, raising questions of sustainability, as well as design: who&rsquo;s research questions should the tool help answer, and who do we need to point in another direction?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Or <a href=\"http://omeka.org\" target=\"_blank\">Omeka</a> &ndash; an archive management system built at the Centre for History and New Media at George Mason University, and used for everything from student projects to post-disaster archiving. Again, it would take at least 40 minutes to introduce the methodological implications of a tool like that. Omeka makes it incredibly easy to produce historical archives, allowing content that might never be able to be made available otherwise available to very wide audiences. It has deep pedagogical as well as methodological implications, and huge implications for public history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Or <a href=\"http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Mapping the Republic of Letters</a>, the famous Stanford University project that used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to map correspondence amongst Enlightenment philosophers? No chance. Its sophisticated visualizations entrance us, but the scholarly findings it produced require significant engagement with the historical literature for proper understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Each of these examples is comparable to a monograph in the demands it places on interpretation, in other words. And perhaps moreso if we remember that any adequate interpretation will attend to the technical and architectural issues alongside more traditional questions of interpretation and method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://jsorg-docker-static.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2019/02/28/dh-dm-slide8.png\" style=\"float:left; height:318px; margin:4px; width:553px\" />So where do we start? To get down to brass tacks, we need to reduce our argument to the purely abstract level, represented here in a random database diagram I found online. Each of these fields represents a piece of data, the data model as a whole representing the sum total of the information and its inter-relationships held in the database it was used to build. Our core theoretical and methodological problems as historians in a digital age &ndash; if we are to analyse the issue at the level of abstraction it deserves &ndash; is to work out our epistemological relationship to this collection of - can I say &lsquo;<em>data as data</em>&rsquo;? Not &lsquo;<em>content as data&rsquo;</em> (not a digitized manuscript, or even metadata about a manuscript), but simply the logical representation of digital bits organised in digital space. How do we confront that, theoretically and methodologically? What opportunities does it offer, and what problems does it create?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">It turns out that the theoretical and methodological implications are rather profound and have a neat tie-in with two seminal essays (or more accurately, &lsquo;thought experiments&rsquo;) in historical theory, both published in 1960: Isaiah Berlin&rsquo;s article &lsquo;The Concept of Scientific History&rsquo; published in the first issue of <em>History and Theory</em>,[6] and Thomas Nagel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Determinism in History&rsquo; published in <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>.[7] The essays were written at the height of professional angst about Marxist interpretations of history that brought issues of economic and technological determinism to the fore. (I sometimes wonder if historical logic had a similar resonance in Cold War Europe to our various &lsquo;digital&rsquo; logics today, in its pressing relationship to political economy and statecraft.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Berlin pressed the case for History being an inductive science, taking readers through a rigorous logical process to demonstrate that, in the end, such a method would always fall short. Human societies cohere around stories about the past that will always result in different interpretations of events: final historical knowledge is a chimera, the historical record is too fragmentary to support it and human culture too unstable to transmit it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Nagel&rsquo;s article could be said to have dealt with the same topic from the other side of the coin. He asked whether history was determined and could therefore be deduced from universal laws. In much the same way as Berlin, after walking readers through rigorous logical steps, he decided that yes History <em>was</em> in fact determined&hellip;.but only at the very large and very small scales. Like quantum physics, strange phenomena were at work that made it impossible to capture universal historical Truth on the wing. At the end of the day, both philosophers decided, History depended too much on <em>narrative</em> to ever be classed as an inductive or deductive science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">We&rsquo;ve come a long way since the 1960s but that tension at the heart of History as a discipline - between science and narrative &ndash; still exists. I suspect that the turn towards digital history (especially data-intensive digital history) will intensify it. The urge to turn History into a nomothetic science has existed for centuries, of course. Berlin notes that the tendency was especially strong in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, following Auguste Comte. The goal was worthy: to produce a vast labor-saving system that could automate the historical imagination, and &lsquo;like a perpetual motion machine&rsquo; continuously generate new insights into the past independent of human bias, drawn only from a vast ocean of facts. [8] Epistemological niceties such as the relative merits of inductive or deductive method would become trivialities next to the great firehoses of historical knowledge that would be produced. Theorists taught us the folly of such imaginings during the twentieth century, though, didn&rsquo;t they? Hayden White, Keith Jenkins, Frank Ankersmit and company: all is narrative, and representation&hellip;.and even (following Fukuyama) the end of History itself? Positivism has not fared well in historical theory over the past 50 years or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">But digital history changes that, in ways that I don&rsquo;t think the historical profession has quite grasped yet. Berlin and Nagel would have been fascinated by the myriad online services cropping up, with names like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Sagemaker</a>, that allow data scientists to analyse massive datasets with minimal infrastructural overhead. I&rsquo;m sure if Auguste Comte was confronted with <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\" target=\"_blank\">Google&rsquo;s Ngram viewer</a>, which allows you to search for words and their immediate collocates (or &lsquo;Ngrams&rsquo;) across millions of volumes, he would have immediately typed in &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; and waited for the results. But he would have been disappointed wouldn&rsquo;t he.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Numerous studies have pointed out the inadequacies of the Google Books corpus, from inadequate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and metadata to collections compromised by the inclusion of scientific papers &ndash; and the primary problem of it being a library, with one copy of each book, making it impossible to deduce the historical <em>importance</em> of any single book or word.[9] As invaluable as it is when used with caution (and even better, via the tools available at the <a href=\"https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\" target=\"_blank\">Hathi Trust Research Centre</a>), the underlying dataset (think of that data model slide I showed earlier) is at best tainted and at worst horribly misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Tim Hitchcock made a good point when he noted that the &lsquo;Googleization&rsquo; of the world has led to a &lsquo;deracination of knowledge&rsquo; rather than a transition towards all-knowing machines, uprooting &lsquo;what was once a coherent collection of beliefs and systems for discovering and performing taxonomies on information&rsquo;.[10] As promising as the many new services are, any purity of &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; method attained through the logical rigour of a Berlin or Nagel can easily be confounded by poor quality data or na&iuml;ve application of analytical tools. I&rsquo;m not saying that Google Ngrams is of no use to historians, then &ndash; I will probably use it in an important section of my next book &ndash; but it needs to be used with caution and due diligence. Nomothetic it most definitely is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">But we historians are a persistent bunch, and that nomothetic machine sounds very cool. I suspect that&rsquo;s the reason we&rsquo;re now seeing a new generation of very large-scale data intensive projects that aim to produce very large <em>but also very high-quality datasets</em>, that will be more conducive to scientific methods than Google Books. We&rsquo;re entering an era of the &lsquo;historical macroscope&rsquo;,[11] and it holds great promise. By not only attending to the quality of the underlying datasets and organising data models, but providing powerful analytical tools and reproducible workflows, projects are pushing the boundaries of empirically grounded history and enabling <em>a range of </em>methods: inductive, deductive, and merely exploratory. True, the datasets and tools will always be limited when placed against the great oceans of the historical past, but they offer hope of real iterative improvement and a degree of transparency and reproducibility hitherto thought impossible. In many ways they are an example of historians showing the engineers at Google how to do things properly: take care with your sources, make sure your provenance is sound and your arguments traceable, let other people test and share your findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">But just as our friendly positivists start sitting forward on their seats in anticipation, push-button truth slips from our grasp again. Because many of the most interesting analytical techniques &ndash; often used to explore the very large datasets &ndash; are neither inductive nor deductive<em> but probabilistic.</em> Straight-forward word counts, or searches for places of interest or dates will always be useful (and these large new datasets will surely provide plenty of fodder for that kind of work), but a lot of the work they enable will be enabled in turn by algorithms driving mathematical models of remarkable complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Rather than working from a preconceived theory, or building a theory up using discrete pieces of data, probabilistic methods use Bayesian statistics to establish a <em>degree of belief</em> &ndash; which can be updated as new information comes to light. This is no place for a lesson on Bayesian statistics from a numerically challenged historian but &ndash; to over-simplify things to a reckless degree &ndash; we could perhaps view it as a mathematically mediated compromise between inductive and deductive methods, allowing the researcher to move between their preconceived expectations and the available evidence in an ongoing process of refinement and calibration. The mathematical models that determine this process are various, and complex. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA, is one of the best known amongst digital humanists.[12] It is implemented in so-called &lsquo;topic modelling&rsquo; algorithms, which traverse corpuses of texts grouping together semantically similar words into &lsquo;topics&rsquo; they &lsquo;probably&rsquo; correspond to. The results can range from being utterly opaque to quite revealing but are neither inductively or deductively provable. Researchers are confronted with a gestalt of information that needs to be weighed and incorporated into their narratives as evidence based on a very wide range of factors, from the quality of the dataset, to the chosen mathematical model, and calibrations made to the algorithm implementing the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A wide variety of these techniques exist, variously gathered under the label of &lsquo;machine learning&rsquo;. Any historians using them need to take great care with what might be termed &lsquo;methodological hygiene&rsquo;, carefully delimiting the boundaries of their probabilistic evidence and taking great care to colligate it against a wide variety of other more straight-forward historical evidence. Having large high-quality datasets is one thing: understanding your algorithms and their mathematical models is another thing entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">I was a little worried a couple of years ago that the DH community were adopting probabilistic machine learning methods uncritically, making claims that couldn&rsquo;t be supported by the methods, but that problem seems to have dissipated. It might be related to increasing publicity about the dangers of probabilistic methods even for the hard sciences, with commentators noting the drastic fall in replicable studies in a range of disciplines, but I suspect it was simply that most historians who experimented with the techniques shrank away in horror at the opaqueness of the results and the complexity of implementation. For most of us the only option is to enlist the help of colleagues in the computational sciences and statistics, which I did in a study of the Old Bailey Online in 2015.[13] CEDHAR&rsquo;s relationships with colleagues in computational statistics and humanities computing will be important to ensure that kind of work is done to a high quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">As ever, though, the trick is to view this kind of evidence as just one more historical source, with its own affordances and limitations. Some excellent work has appeared deploying probabilistic methods and reporting on them in responsible ways. Eun So and Mark Algee-Hewitt provided useful insights into the past using neural networks in an article they produced last year, but actively resisted overly empirical readings of their work, noting that &lsquo;As with other digital humanities applications of machine learning, these &ldquo;distant&rdquo; or &ldquo;macro&rdquo; findings aid us in formulating globally-aware hypotheses but require closer analysis for more substantial humanist interpretations.&rsquo; [14] Roe, Gladstone, and Morrissey are similarly circumspect in their claims, despite offering fascinating insights into Enlightenment discourse. These kinds of papers are, to my mind, like specialist legal or medical opinions: the ones that have been accepted by the community become strong sources of historical evidence, but only ever within the very tight constraints they define for themselves. A good computational statistician will guide historians towards the right approach but be prepared to be an active traveller on the journey: defining datasets, choosing appropriate algorithms, and testing for accuracy require significant amounts of domain knowledge. This is history as a team sport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">So really, after taking this deepest of dives into the complexities of (one particular) mode of digital history, where do we end up? If you ask me we&rsquo;re back at the same place Berlin, and Nagel, and many other theoreticians have landed since time immemorial: narrative &amp; representation. The digital modern entangles historian with a complex new range of tools, from digital archives to mathematical models, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the fundamental theoretical concerns that lie at the heart of History as a discipline. Unlike in the hard sciences, the question isn&rsquo;t so much whether these fancy new techniques are undermining the status of History as a discipline, but how they are best integrated into our existing practices, and whether they require us to change the way we represent the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">And we don&rsquo;t always need to reach for new concepts, like I did with the digital modern. In rehabilitating Hayden White from his more venomous critics in 1998, Frank Ankersmit pointed out his fascination with the Greek &lsquo;middle voice&rsquo;, a mode of speech somewhere between the active and passive voice: not &lsquo;I wash&rsquo; or &lsquo;I am washed&rsquo; but &lsquo;I wash myself&rsquo;. The middle voice suggested to White a way to reconcile the contradictory impulses at the heart of History as a discipline: a way to transcend the subject / object dichotomy implicit in both our sources and the stories we write about them.[16] It seems nicely suited to the new-found complexities of our Bayesian age, too, doesn&rsquo;t it. For me, it suggests a depth of continuity we should aspire to as we seek to integrate digital history with our theoretical and historiographical traditions. Not only Google and Amazon, but also Herodotus and Thucydides. Nothing less will do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Centers like CEDHAR offer us the opportunity to naturalise exciting new tools and methods deep into the historical grain of our disciplinary practices, speaking to long-standing debates and issues in historiography, theory, and method. We are only at the start of a long journey in digital history, navigating our way through &ndash; and I hope eventually out of &ndash; the digital modern into something more elegant, more integrated into our traditional approaches to history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">That will take a great deal of experimentation with a wide variety of tools and methods. I wish Helle and Adela and the many colleagues who will join you in CEDHAR well, as you explore the many possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><u>References</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">1] James Smithies, <em>The Digital Humanities and the Digital Modern</em> (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), pp.9-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">2] Ethan Kleinberg, Joan Wallach Scott, and Gary Wilder. &ldquo;Theses on Theory and History.&rdquo; Accessed January 28, 2019. <a href=\"http://theoryrevolt.com\">http://theoryrevolt.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">3] W.J.

        "excerpt": "<p>I&rsquo;ll be leaving King&rsquo;s Digital Lab (KDL) this month, after 6 wonderful years, for a new role as Professor of Digital Humanities in King&rsquo;s Department of Digital Humanities (DDH).

        "body": "<p>Cross-posted from <a href=\"https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/blog/smithies-departure/\">https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/blog/smithies-departure/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll be leaving King&rsquo;s Digital Lab (KDL) this month, after 6 wonderful years, for a new role as Professor of Digital Humanities in King&rsquo;s Department of Digital Humanities (DDH). Although merely a move over to the other half of Digital Humanities at King&rsquo;s, and a return to a department I used to hold a fractional appointment in, it represents a significant milestone in my career. I&rsquo;m grateful to the many people who have supported me to this point, in New Zealand, Australia, Jordan, and the United States, as well as the UK.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\r\n<p>Primarily, though, the change represents a major milestone for King&rsquo;s Digital Lab. I&rsquo;ve always wanted someone else to follow me as director, to ensure the creative, intellectual, and administrative health of the team, but the timing had to be right. Building new research facilities is hard work, especially if the goal is to see them endure. Sustainability doesn&rsquo;t only require a succession of high-quality projects, but stewardship of existing ones, funding and design of technical infrastructure, definition of <a href=\"https://github.com/kingsdigitallab/sdlc-for-rse\">engineering</a>, governance, financial, and administrative processes, and definition of reporting metrics. In KDL&rsquo;s case it also involved the development of <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/2564790\">Research Software Engineering (RSE) roles and career pathways</a>, to help recruit and retain the best team possible and provide them with equitable conditions. As <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429777028-13/humans-loop-james-smithies-arianna-ciula\">Arianna Ciula and I have noted</a>, this institutional &lsquo;conceptual work&rsquo; has direct parallels in the establishment of research laboratories across all disciplines over many centuries and intersects with foundational issues in research method and epistemology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\r\n<p>That is a lot of work for a relatively small team to deliver in six years, quite aside from the legacy maintenance of <a href=\"http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/1/000411/000411.html\">100 inherited projects</a> and renewal of the significant server infrastructure they are hosted on. King&rsquo;s College London&rsquo;s generosity helped keep a sizeable proportion of those projects going, but technical, security, and funding issues sometimes prove unsurmountable. We can only hope that improvements in the UK&rsquo;s arts &amp; humanities research infrastructure provides the additional support that&rsquo;s needed in future years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\r\n<p>KDL has, of course, been primarily focused on the development of new projects. The team of between 12 and 18 RSEs receive upwards of 200 project ideas each year, from inside and outside King&rsquo;s. Since its establishment in 2015 we have been involved in ~&pound;78m of grant applications and ~&pound;13m of successful bids. These projects have involved colleagues in a wide range of institutions: departments in the faculties of Arts &amp; Humanities, Natural &amp; Mathematical Sciences, and Social Science &amp; Public Policy at King&rsquo;s College London; UK universities including Oxford, Sussex, and Hull; overseas universities such as William &amp; Mary, the Australian National University (ANU), the University of Melbourne, and Hashemite University; and cultural partners such as Stanford University Press, the British Museum, and the Royal Archives. In 2018 - 2019 we were involved in 40 grant submissions, with 25 successful. The team consistently work on multiple major, minor, and legacy projects at once, far exceeding the workload of government and commercial engineering teams I&rsquo;ve worked with. Their diligence and commitment to research and technical quality is second to none, and partnerships with them are understandably in high demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\r\n<p>I am most proud of KDL&rsquo;s culture, however. Like many RSEs, anyone in the team could choose to work in the commercial or government sector but KDLers have chosen to devote their careers to the arts and humanities and wider cultural sector. Those values lie at the core of the Lab, represented in a commitment to open source and open standards, technical sustainability, and research quality. It also extends to a genuine and caring team culture and open knowledge sharing (anyone exposed to the joys and insights of KDL&rsquo;s Slack channel knows what I mean), and a commitment to diversity, flexibility, and emotional honesty. I owe my personal wellbeing to that culture, which guided us through COVID-19 and many other challenges. I&rsquo;m humbled to join the many people who have benefitted from the teams&rsquo; collective &lsquo;lifeworld&rsquo; (a phrase from philosopher of technology Don Ihde that feels particularly apposite) including fixed term staff, post-doctoral fellows, early career researchers, and student interns.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\r\n<p>KDL has been more than a research facility for me in intellectual as well as personal terms. As I&rsquo;ve suggested, with Arianna and Patrick ffrench in a forthcoming book chapter, KDL can be viewed as a techno-philosophical experiment that reimagines the boundaries of scholarly production. At the core of that activity is a desire to fundamentally rethink the relationship between technology and the humanities, elevating RSEs to the status of what Gilbert Simondon referred to as &ldquo;mecanologues&rdquo;, equipped to advocate and speak for and with the machines we co-exist with. This is symbolic of the next phase of digital humanities qua humanities, where machines of various sorts are increasingly drawn into the core practices and culture of scholarship and debate, and people with the expertise to design, develop, and maintain them are sought after. Raising our expectations of digital humanities design, engineering, and scholarship to this level assumes a contribution to and engagement with foundational issues in not only epistemology and method but human and machine ethics, and wider issues in economy, society, and culture.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\r\n<p>My move to King&rsquo;s Department of Digital Humanities, where those issues are actively explored and taught, is natural. I look forward to continued collaboration with KDL, renewed collaboration across DDH, and new adventures with colleagues across the UK and globally. In the meantime, I suggest everyone watches KDL closely: great things await.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>",

This lecture suggests it is time to pause and consider the effect this &lsquo;digital turn&rsquo; has had on our relationship to the past, and whether some older intellectual frameworks might help us grasp the momentous changes occurring around us. Digital tools will remain important for the foreseeable future, of course, but in the context of an ever-evolving relationship between self and world. It is inevitable they will withdraw to the background of consciousness to join the cars, planes, power stations, and myriad complex systems that shape everyday life. Silicon Valley marketing will sound increasingly hollow, political manipulation increasingly outrageous, technical inadequacies increasingly tiresome. The denouement of our fascination with digital technologies will occur naturally as intellectual assimilation proceeds, just as previous eras assimilated mechanical, industrial, and electrical technologies. Many perspectives will be needed for this to occur, but a reconsideration of our relationship to modernity is one of the most important. For decades, modernity was viewed by scholars as the driving force behind not only scientific and technological advance, but the violent incursions of colonialism and the miseries of child labour and environmental despoliation. The issues we face today seem clearly connected to those processes, and yet we continue to prioritize exploration of &lsquo;the digital&rsquo;, as if we have somehow exited modernity and entered a cyberutopian end game that can only be resolved by the deus ex machina of artificial intelligence. Why did we stop conceiving of ourselves as inhabiting modernity? Why have &lsquo;industrial modernity&rsquo; and &lsquo;post-industrial modernity&rsquo; not been followed by &lsquo;digital modernity&rsquo;? And, more importantly, what would an intellectually robust and ethically sound description of digital modernity entail?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Slides</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"389\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRS5bznYI1Ju642d9kuvuj_2E1T8XFtx6yrDA5zOyhJ8X2PSqG8aUhCIdsSrItl2Q/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>",

The project brought together a large interdisciplinary team (39 members over its lifetime) to leverage more than twenty-years&rsquo; worth of digitisation projects in order to deepen our understanding of the impact of mechanisation on nineteenth-century Britain. In contrast to many previous digital humanities projects which have sought to create resources, the project was concerned to work with what was already there, which whilst straightforward in theory is complex in practice. This Element describes the efforts to do so. It outlines the challenges of establishing and managing a truly multidisciplinary digital humanities project in the complex landscape of cultural data in the United Kingdom and shares what other projects seeking to undertake digital history projects can learn from the experience.
